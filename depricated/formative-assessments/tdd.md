Data Assignment: 

Write a script called factorial.py that takes a number and returns its factorial. 

Steps:
Think about which tests you want to do on that function.
Write the tests first.
Test an empty function called factorial - it should fail the tests
Add code for returning the factorial of a number - it should pass for numbers >= 1
Add code for dealing with zero - should pass unit test for zero and for numbers >= 1
Add code for dealing with negative numbers
Add code for dealing with non-numeric input

Take a screenshot test of all the stages as you write the program.
Upload your assignment to Github once you are done.

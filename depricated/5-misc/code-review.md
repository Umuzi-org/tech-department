# Code Review Session

Once a project has been submitted and reviewed then a group code-review session will be held by a tech team staff member. The review will:

- highlight outstanding work
- highlight common problems and solutions
- get a few of the recruits to explain their reasoning and code structures publicly
- give the recruits a chance to ask questions and give feedback

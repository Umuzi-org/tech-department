A recruitâ€™s journey starts with a three-day programme called Make Umuzi Better. The recruits are expected to work in a team to tackle issues at Umuzi--anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.

There are a few goals to this program:

- recruits are introduced to Human Centered Design principles (HCD)
- recruits are submerged into Umuzi culture from the get go
- recruits are empowered to make useful contributions to Umuzi as an organisation and community

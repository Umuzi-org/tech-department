Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp
During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic HTML and CSS skills through free online platforms (currently FreeCodeCamp and Khan Academy). In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.


During a two-week bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuzi’s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning through FreeCodeCamp and are given a series of challenges. There are two short web development challenges they complete in their first week. In the second week, they start learning JavaScript and are given 5 simple challenges, as well as a more difficult problem (we don’t expect them to solve the difficult problem, we only ask them to walk us through their approach for trying to solve it). In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of group games and challenges to learn how they work with a team and under pressure. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.

## Month 0: #MakeUmuziBetter
A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called Make Umuzi Better. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi--anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.
Months 1-4: Game Development Curriculum
The first few months for a Umuzi Web Dev recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5).

During this time they are spending the first hour of each day going through lessons of FreeCodeCamp (primarily increasing their JavaScript knowledge).

A note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation:
Umuzi is a registered training provider with MICT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognise their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements. Below we refer to the formal NCIT requirements e.g. 01: Business and technology.

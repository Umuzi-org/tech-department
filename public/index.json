In the past, Umuzi has used a combination of Google Forms and other, off-the-shelf, tools, to create an online application process for applicants. Now, under the leadership of Umuzi’s Data Science and Web Development managers, a team of Umuzi recruits is developing a custom solution which will allow applicants to apply to Umuzi, complete a variety of online learning and tests, enable managers to easily sort candidates by results, and automatically handle communications with the candidates. It’s through real builds like this that recruits put their learning into practice. Additional learning In addition to the curriculum listed above, the recruits participate in workshops given by industry professionals and Umuzi staff. Generally there are 2-3 workshops each month. Topics include time management, public speaking, networking, preparing for technical interviews, introduction to new frameworks, tech trends, etc.\nRecruits are also encouraged to attend industry meetups, conferences, and hackathons. On average, recruits attend 1 meetup/conference per month and 1-2 hackathons during their time at Umuzi.\n"

	"content": " Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic HTML and CSS skills through free online platforms (currently FreeCodeCamp and Khan Academy). In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.\nDuring a two-week bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuzi’s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning through FreeCodeCamp and are given a series of challenges. There are two short web development challenges they complete in their first week. In the second week, they start learning JavaScript and are given 5 simple challenges, as well as a more difficult problem (we don’t expect them to solve the difficult problem, we only ask them to walk us through their approach for trying to solve it). In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of group games and challenges to learn how they work with a team and under pressure. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.\nMonth 0: #MakeUmuziBetter A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called Make Umuzi Better. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi\u0026ndash;anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests. Months 1-4: Game Development Curriculum The first few months for a Umuzi Web Dev recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5).\nDuring this time they are spending the first hour of each day going through lessons of FreeCodeCamp (primarily increasing their JavaScript knowledge).\nA note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation: Umuzi is a registered training provider with MICT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognise their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements. Below we refer to the formal NCIT requirements e.g. 01: Business and technology.\nWeek 1: Linux and intro to curriculum Command line bootcamp Introduction to game development (NCIT curriculum) 01: Business and technology 02: Ethics and Professionalism in IT\nWeek 2: Useful tools and personal portfolio Git 101 workshop Project management with Trello (first intro to Agile and Scrum methodologies) Development of a personal website to showcase a portfolio of their work\nWeek 3: Personal portfolio and game research Continue to work on portfolio website Game development curriculum 03: Conducting research and user interviews Workshop: Survey design and analysis in Google Forms Assignment: Research notes\nWeek 4: Technical reports Game development curriculum 04: Writing a report on game research Assignment: technical report Portfolio websites due\nWeek 5: Presentations and feedback Game development curriculum 05: Presentations on game research Assignment: 10-min presentation with slides 06: Giving and receiving constructive feedback\nWeek 6: Web design Game development curriculum 07: History of the Internet and online gaming 08: Web design for business 09: Building an online business\nWeek 7: Project management and problem solving Game development curriculum 10: Agile project management 11: Agile meetings 12: Thinking like a machine (boolean algebra, logic) Workshop: Problem solving techniques\nWeek 8: Version control and documentation Game development curriculum 13: Version control (GIT) 14: Pseudocode and documentation Workshop: Project organization and naming conventions\nWeek 9: OOP Game development curriculum 15: Object-oriented programming Assignment: OOP person class Discuss game idea\nWeek 10: Game development workshop Workshop on game development in HTML5 Build Breakout game through live demos Game development curriculum Assignment: OOP due Watch game dev tutorials Finalize game idea\nWeek 11: Test-driven development and catch-up Game development curriculum 16: Test-driven development Assignment: TDD assignment with Mocha.js Watch game dev tutorials Catch up on assignments, readings, assessments for the curriculum\nWeek 12: Game development Game development curriculum Build game\nWeek 13: Game development Game development curriculum Build game Assignment: MVP of game due\nWeek 14: Node.js Workshop: Asynchronous vs synchronous code Workshop: Introduction to Node.js\nWeek 15: Database development Game development curriculum Assignment: Add login functionality to game using Node 17: Database development\nWeek 16: MongoDB Workshop: Using mongoDB to store user information Game development curriculum Assignment: Add database to game to store user data\nWeek 17: MySQL Workshop: Intro to mySQL and relational databases Game development curriculum Continue development of version 2\nWeek 18: Analytics and user feedback Game development curriculum 18: Analytics Assignment: add Google Analytics to game website Assignment: create user survey to collect feedback\nWeek 19: Search and sort techniques Game development curriculum 19: Search and sort Assignment: search and sort algorithms Continue game development based on feedback\nWeek 20: Finishing the game Game development curriculum Final version of game due 20: Software development process review\nMonths 5-9: Product Teams After recruits have finished with the formal qualification and their HTML5 game, they move on to working on our product teams.\nProduct teams are teams of no more than 6 recruits guided by a product owner (Umuzi staff).

	"content": " Take Note This is a Test Driven Development Project. Please follow a test driven methodologies. That means that you write your test code first!\nThe basic idea of TDD is to write the test code before you write any actual code. So you write a test (which will fail) then you write the code that will make the test pass.\nWhen you submit your code (on Github people!) then your tests MUST BE included in your code base.\nIn a professional setting, untested code is incomplete code.\nIn general: Follow recognised best practices around whatever language and test framework you are using. Eg: consistent naming conventions of functions, test files and literally everything else. Literally.\nInstructions Write a software system for keeping track of bowling scores. You can read about traditional 10 pin bowling scoring here.\nPlease put your tests in a directory named \u0026ldquo;tests\u0026rdquo; (unless the testing framework you are using follows some other convention(which is unlikely)).\nInitial inputs: The names of the players eg \u0026ldquo;Uncle Bob Martin\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Ada Lovelace\u0026rdquo;\nGameplay Once the game has started, the players take turns until the game is concluded. Each player gets to throw the bowling ball up to three times during their turn. Each time they throw they can knock down up to a maximum of 10 pins.\nPLEASE DO NOT IMPLEMENT A FANCY GUI. we dont care to see the bowling pins or the ball, we dont care about physics.\nThe only input that will matter here is the number of pins knocked over.\nOutputs We should be able to access at any point in time:\n the total score of any player the \u0026ldquo;leaderboard\u0026rdquo; of the current game (who is in first place, second, third etc) the points any person accumulated during a single turn (aka frame) how many turns are left who\u0026rsquo;s turn is it now? whose turn is it next?

	"content": " Assignment 1: Basics Assignment Description\nCreate a class called Person which defines the generic data and functionality of a person. Now as we know there are a lot of things involved with a Person e.g (age,gender,their address, height, shoe size, passport number, etc). but in this case we are only interested in showing their name, age, gender, and interests, and we also want to be able to write a short introduction about them based on this data, and get them to say Hello. This is known as abstraction in OOP ,creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for our program\u0026rsquo;s purposes.\nRemember! From your Person class, you will create object instances — objects that contain the data and functionality defined in the class.\nE.g) Class: Person Name Surname Age Gender Interests: an array of activities/interests Full Name: returns the person’s Name + Surname Greeting: “Hello I’m +Name!”\nObject: FirstPerson Name: Nosipho Surname: Masondo Age: 8 Gender: Female Interests: Dancing,Singing Greeting: “Hello I’m Nosipho”\nObject: SecondPerson Name: Thando Surname: Ngwane Age:16 Gender: Male Interests: playing games,drawing Method: I am Thando Ngwane I am 16 and my interests are playing games and and drawing.\nWhen an object instance is created from a class, the class\u0026rsquo;s constructor function is run to create it. This process of creating an object instance from a class is called instantiation — the object instance is instantiated from the class.\nIn JavaScript we use special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features.They are useful because you\u0026rsquo;ll often come across situations in which you don\u0026rsquo;t know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\nI hope this information is useful!\n\u000cAssignment 2: Dice You’ve all seen dice before. A die (singular for dice) usually has 6 sides, but can have more. Eg 20 sided dice are a thing.\nA die has a value (eg if 1 dot is showing then the value is 1). When a die is rolled then it’s value randomly changes. A six sided die has a ⅙ chance of landing on any of the sides.\nA weighted die is less random. A weighted die has a higher chance of landing on a specific number (or specific numbers).\nDraw a class diagram to represent the above Write the code\nDice are made in a factory. A factory can only make one kind of die. Eg there could be a factory that only makes 6 sided dice, and another factory that only makes 20 sided dice.\nFactories are imperfect, sometimes there are manufacturing flaws. Every factory has a possibility of creating a weighted die by mistake.\n Create a DiceFactory class. It should have a method called makeDie that outputs a single die instance  Since dice factories are imperfect, their outputted dice need to be tested. A dice tester can test one die at a time. It tests the die by rolling it a bunch of times and checking that the results are properly random. A dice tester can only test one kind of die, for example one dice tester might only test 6 sided dice, and another might only test 20 sided dice.\n Write a class to represent a DiceTester. It should have a method called testDie that has a single die as an input and returns True if the die is fair. If the wrong kind of Die is input then the DiceTester should be able to detect that and log an error.  \u000cAssignment 3: Compound interest A Bank Account has a balance, an interest rate and a monthly fee.\nFor example if a person has an interest rate of 12% (which is totally unrealistic but make the numbers easier) and they have R1000 in their bank account then they will receive (R1000 x 12% / 12) after one month of saving. That means they earned R10 in interest. Now if their monthly fee on that account is R50 then their final balance after 1 month is R1000+R10-R50 = R960.\nThe balance of a bank account can also change if a deposit or withdrawal is made. Money can also be transferred between bank accounts.\nA bank account also has a type, for example Cheque, Savings or Credit Card. Bank accounts belong to People. One person can own multiple bank accounts.\nA bank account also has a number that uniquely identifies it within the bank. If I wanted to transfer money from my bank account to yours then all I should need is your bank account number.\nDraw a UML diagram that depicts all the classes described above Write code to match your UML\n"

What: The team hashes out different story point from the product manager, converting them into tickets that are an appropriate size with unambiguous requirements. Why: So every ticket is clear on what needs to be accomplished.  Review  When: At the end of every sprint What: Team demos all work done for an audience including, but not limited to, stakeholders \u0026amp; team members Why: It\u0026rsquo;s not only nice to show off work, but it ensures that everything is actually working in harmony.  Retro  When: After the end of every sprint What: The team, with the intention of improving the scrum process, covers the following issues together What went well What went poorly What can be done to improve Why: The scrum process should be adaptable to the organization\u0026rsquo;s needs. This also allows all members of the team to participate and own the process.  Standup  When: Every day What: Team answers following questions in order - What did I do to advance the team\u0026rsquo;s goals in the sprint yesterday? - What is impeding me from working on the team\u0026rsquo;s goals for this sprint? All other discussions are tabled for smaller groups afterwards Why: Helps to adapt to problems that come up, and to initiate conversation about different topics.  General issue board procedure Every time you move a ticket from one column to another, you are unassigning yourself. A ticket in the done column is reassigned to the person who did the development work on it. Comment on the tickets as a form of taking notes \u0026amp; passing on explanations from one person to another. Attach all resources to the ticket whether they are points of reference, design documents, etc. Name the tickets so there is no confusion as to what is being accomplished. Add every requirement to the checklist, and be specific. Check off requirements as you finish work on them in development.\nBacklog Items in the backlog represent the conceived work for the team over the next 2-3+ sprints. Before items are able to be moved into the \u0026ldquo;To Do\u0026rdquo; column, they need to be looked over by the team during the \u0026ldquo;Storytime\u0026rdquo; meeting to make sure that the objectives are clear. Various labeling/measuring can take place on these tickets, like adding the feature they\u0026rsquo;re associated with, the estimated work hours to complete the feature, and more.\nTo Do Tickets in to-do are in the queue for the team\u0026rsquo;s current sprint. The team commits to completing a given amount of tickets in the coming sprint during the \u0026ldquo;Planning\u0026rdquo; meeting.\nDeveloping Tickets moved to developing are being actively worked on by the person assigned to them.\nGit Action Before any coding occurs, pull down the latest version from \u0026ldquo;origin/master\u0026rdquo;. Then, after coding is finished, create a new branch with a name corresponding to your ticket. Commit, push to origin, and create a pull request in Github.\nCode Review Tickets in code review are having their associated code (or design) reviewed. A team member will look at the pull request on Github and see that the code is well formed, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have obvious bugs, and accomplishes what it set out to do. If necessary, changes are suggested, and the ticket is sent back to development.\nGit Action If the code passes review, the pull request is approved and the branch is merged into master.\nQuality Assurance Tickets in quality assurance are being checked to make sure the user experiences what the ticket was set out to accomplish. If there\u0026rsquo;s bugs or missing functionality, send it back to development. ####Git Action Pull the merge commit from origin/master for testing.\nDone: Tickets here are done.\n"

Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.\nDuring bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuzi’s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning, presenting the results of their work at the end of the bootcamp. In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of teamwork challenges to learn how they communicate within a team and work under pressure; as well as individual tasks to assess ability to follow instructions, control impulsive reactions and plan actions. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.\n"

To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests. Months 1-5: Systems Development and Data Science The first few months for a Umuzi tech recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5), while also learning basic data science concepts.\nA note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation: Umuzi is a registered training provider with MICT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognise their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements.

	"title": "Basic introduction to Redux",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Redux is  marketed as a state managment tool. It can be used to manage state an a whole lot more usually used with React or other frontend web framework concepts are similar to the Command Pattern. This is an OOP design pattern that unlocks a lot of stuff beyond simple state managment  Resources The basics:\n This tutorial is really good: https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial This logger middleware helps: https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger  If you want to start using redux with asyncronous code (eg ajax requests) then you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use another tool:\n for simple stuff: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk for complicated side-effect models something like this is probably better: https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga  Concepts There are a few concepts that are super important\nStore Lets say you are making a TODO application. This application has a beautiful frontend that automatically renders your todo items from a datastructure. Something like this:\nconst store = { todos : [ {title: \u0026quot;get groceries\u0026quot;, done: false}, {title: \u0026quot;call mom\u0026quot;, done: true}, {title: \u0026quot;learn Redux\u0026quot;, done: false}, {title: \u0026quot;walk dog\u0026quot;, done: false}, ] }  In redux, the store is immutable. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what that implies when we talk about reducers a little later.\nTools like React make it easy to take an application state and turn it into widgets but we wont get into that just yet. You can do this with pure vanilla JavaScript by looping over our todos and simply appending DOM elements.\nAction An action is also a JSON object. Here are some examples:\n{type: \u0026quot;ADD_TODO\u0026quot;, title: \u0026quot;pay rent\u0026quot;} {type: \u0026quot;DELETE_TODO\u0026quot;, index: 2} {type: \u0026quot;SET_DONE\u0026quot;, index: 1, done: true} {type: \u0026quot;SET_DONE\u0026quot;, index: 1, done: false}  Given the example \u0026ldquo;store\u0026rdquo; we set up above can you see what effects these actions should have? What does it look like we are trying to do here?\nNow there is some weird language around this. If you want Redux to execute an action then you dispatch the action. Then Redux should update the store through use of a reducer (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to those soon).\nSo if we wanted Redux to actually add a thing to our todo list we would do something like:\ndispatch({type: \u0026quot;ADD_TODO\u0026quot;, title: \u0026quot;pay rent\u0026quot;})  This is kinda a pain to write out so usually instead of doing thigs like this we make use of action creators. Eg:\nconst ADD_TODO = \u0026quot;ADD_TODO\u0026quot; function addTodo(title){ //action creator // validation maybe return {type: ADD_TODO, title: title} } dispatch(addTodo(\u0026quot;learn redux\u0026quot;))  Reducer Reducers are the things that execute actions on the state. Here is an example following from the above:\nconst initialState = { // note the use of const. This is immutable todos : [1,2,3], stuff : \u0026quot;things\u0026quot; } function theReducer(state = initialState, action){ // {type: ADD_TODO, title: \u0026quot;buy hats\u0026quot;} switch(action.type){ case ADD_TODO: return { ...state, // we copy all the things using some ES6 syntax todos: [...state.todos, {title: action.title, done:false }] } // { // todos : [1,2,3,{type: ADD_TODO, title: \u0026quot;buy hats\u0026quot;}], // stuff : \u0026quot;things\u0026quot; //} case DELETE_TODO: return { stuff } case SET_DONE: return { otherStuff } default: // nothing changes return state } }  A helloworld example We are using ES6 syntax\nBut what about KISS? KISS == Keep It Simple, Stupid\nThis does seem like a complicated way to do a simple thing\u0026hellip; Think about this:\n actions are objects. That means we can store them and track them in different ways. actions are executed in specific ways and have predictable results the hard \u0026ldquo;thinking\u0026rdquo; of your application is all held in reducers so that makes testing easy and consistent we have a history of every hange made to the state of an application  Look up the \u0026ldquo;Command Pattern\u0026rdquo; . Redux isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same but very similar. Therefore there are similar applications.\n Frontend development: different buttons, inputsand widgets dispatch different actions in a predictable way Actions can be grouped. Meaning we can dispatch one action that dispatches a whole lot of different actions Macro recording. We can record the actions a user takes so that we can replay them later Reducers can be in a seperate code-base. we can send actions over a network and dispatch them elsewhere, we can send the same action to multiple computers to allow parallel processing undo/redo functionality becomes trivial feedback: if a number of actions need to be completed in order to complete a large task then we can track the completion of those actions and update a progress bar Actions can be added to a task queue instead of being dispatched immediately transactional behavior: you can have an action like {type: TRANSACTION_BEGIN} and then at some later stage {type: TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK} can be used to undo all the changes that happened in the transaction  Industry Redux is mostly used in the context of React. It is used for frontend development. But there is so much more it could do.\n"

By the end of this excercise you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to create and manage your own git repos\nCreating and managing your own repo Note: you can do all of this stuff from the command line! You should be using linux. Open up a termanal and do the following:\nYour initial commit  Create a directory named git-basic-excercises cd into your new directory look at what\u0026rsquo;s inside using ls -a. It should be empty initialise your git repo using git init. Then check ls -a again. Can you spot the difference? check the status of your repo by typing git status type in touch README.md. This creates a new blank file. Then check ls -a and git status again. type in git log. The output should make sense to you Now add your readme file to your git staging area. Hint: use the git add command Then check your git status again. Can you see the difference? Try to unstage your file and check your git status again Ok, now for your firstcommit: Make sure your readme file is staged then type in git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit\u0026quot; Your output should be something like this:  [master (root-commit) 2103b64] initial commit 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) create mode 100644 README.md  type in git log isn\u0026rsquo;t that nice? press q to exit  more commits!  type in nano README.md. This will open up a text editor. Type in some stuff and then press ctrl x to exit. Then y then enter. This will save your changes type in cat README.md. This will print your file to the console take a look at the git stats again and make sure you understand it commit your changes to your repo. Your commit should have the message \u0026quot;second commit\u0026quot; make some more changes to your readme and make a \u0026quot;third commit\u0026quot;  check this out  type in git log. You should see all your commits there. It should look something like this:  commit a57585d3cf93e64c04e62e58dfe8151d191503cf (HEAD -\u0026gt; master) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:40 2019 +0200 third commit commit a48c005c761902395cf9a50f13ddbffeee4f5537 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:12 2019 +0200 second commit commit 2103b6418ecf4f70effabb639cfad6ac9d57c089 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 14:43:51 2019 +0200 initial commit  Each commit has a \u0026ldquo;hash\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s the weird alphanumeric string thingy.\n Copy the commit hash for your second commit. You can just select it with your mouse and right click and choose \u0026lsquo;copy\u0026rsquo; press q to exit the log view. You should now be back at the terminal type in git checkout and then paste in the commit hash and press enter cat README.md It\u0026rsquo;s like going back in time git checkout master cat README.md Now we are up to date  You can jump to any commit using git checkout. You can checkout a branch, a commit hash, or a tag. We didn\u0026rsquo;t explore tags here.\nWhen you checkout a branch, you checkout the latest commit on that branch.\nbranching The real power of git is in branching. Branching is what alows big teams of developers to work on the same code base. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore branching a little bit.\n git branch This lists all your branches. Git makes a branch named master by default Now create a new branch called milkshake-flavours. git is not too restricive when it comes to naming our branches. It\u0026rsquo;s generally best to choose a name that has something to do with what the branch is for. Our branch is about milkshakes type in git branch. Notice the little *. check out your new branch. type in git branch again and look at the *. Can you see what it means? Try switching between the different branches and see how hings change. Make sure you are on the milkshake-flavours branch then type in nano milkshakes.md and write fill in a few flavours. Mmmm. save and exit what does git status tell you? commit your new file with the message \u0026quot;added initial flavours\u0026quot; take a look at your git log again. It should make sense checkout your master branch. It\u0026rsquo;ll look a little different. Can you see why? from your master branch, create a new branch called history and check it out. If you say git log it should only have three commits type in history \u0026gt; history.txt. Can you guess what it does? commit your changes with the message \u0026quot;added history\u0026quot;. Take a look at the git log now checkout your milkshake branch and look at the git log. it should have your three master commits and your one milkshake commit make some arbitrary changes to the readme file and make a new commit with the message \u0026quot;random readme changes\u0026quot; checkout history again and cat README.md now on your history branchfo the following:  rm README.md echo \u0026quot;booya\u0026quot; \u0026gt; README.md  You should know what these lines do. commit your changes. Use the commit message \u0026quot;rewrote readme\u0026quot; checkout master again  Just make sure we are still on track If you have followed along up until this point then your branches should look like this:\nType in:\ngit checkout master ls  this outputs:\nREADME.md  Check the log:\ngit log  this outputs something like:\ncommit a57585d3cf93e64c04e62e58dfe8151d191503cf (HEAD -\u0026gt; master) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:40 2019 +0200 third commit commit a48c005c761902395cf9a50f13ddbffeee4f5537 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:12 2019 +0200 second commit commit 2103b6418ecf4f70effabb639cfad6ac9d57c089 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 14:43:51 2019 +0200 initial commit  Now lets look at milkshake-flavours:\ngit checkout milkshake-flavours ls  You will see two files:\nmilkshakes.md README.md  And git log will look like:\ncommit d2559d9758f3ec0f7928f6cbef705c6fa9679edf (HEAD -\u0026gt; milkshake-flavours) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:25:07 2019 +0200 added initial flavours commit a57585d3cf93e64c04e62e58dfe8151d191503cf (master) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:40 2019 +0200 third commit commit a48c005c761902395cf9a50f13ddbffeee4f5537 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:12 2019 +0200 second commit commit 2103b6418ecf4f70effabb639cfad6ac9d57c089 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 14:43:51 2019 +0200 initial commit  Finally history:\ngit checkout history ls  there should be two files:\nhistory.txt README.md  and git log outputs\ncommit 34025ac2b26accb7c5c18ec048a4982d3bae8909 (HEAD -\u0026gt; history) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:38:05 2019 +0200 rewrote readme commit b9e3c50fb65c7b2df0f09b921a15a7fc146e0bfb Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:36:04 2019 +0200 added history commit a57585d3cf93e64c04e62e58dfe8151d191503cf (master) Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:40 2019 +0200 third commit commit a48c005c761902395cf9a50f13ddbffeee4f5537 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 15:07:12 2019 +0200 second commit commit 2103b6418ecf4f70effabb639cfad6ac9d57c089 Author: Sheena O'Connell \u0026lt;sheena.oconnell@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Tue Apr 23 14:43:51 2019 +0200 initial commit  merging Now we want to get the master up to date with all out changes. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the milkshake branch\n merge milkshake-flavours into master\ngit checkout master git merge milkshake-flavours  Use ls and git log to see what this did\n merge history into master\n Use ls and git log to see what this did As you can see a whole lot of changes have been made to the master branch\n Now lets take a look at the other branches\ngit checkout history git log ... git checkout milkshake-flavours git log  These branches were not effected by the merge!\n  In general if we want to merge branch X into branch Y:\ngit checkout Y git merge X  This adds a commit to branch Y and doesn\u0026rsquo;t change branch X\n merge the master branch into history. Use git log to see whats up. checkout master again. git log again. Can you spot any differences?  GitHub  Go to Github.com (using your browser of choice) and create a new public repository using the user interface. Name it git-basic-excercises\n You will see a bunch of weird looking things. There is a section entitled \u0026ldquo;…or push an existing repository from the command line\u0026rdquo;. We have an existing reporitory and a command line. So this seems appropriate. Copy the commands from there and paste them into your terminal. this will push your changes to github.\n Refresh your browser. Cool eh?\n  Now you should see a little dropdown box on github that says \u0026ldquo;Branch: master\u0026rdquo;. Click there. your other branches aren\u0026rsquo;t available.\n Push your other branches to github. We want all branches to be listed  Pulling and remotes  You should still be inside the git-basic-excercises directory. Let\u0026rsquo;s get out of there. cd ../ Now let\u0026rsquo;s clone a repo. point your browser here: https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department Now there is a friendly green button that says \u0026ldquo;Clone or download\u0026rdquo;. Click on it. You will see a url come up. Copy it. You will need to paste it into the terminal in a moment In your terminal type in git clone $THE_URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED. It should look something like this: git clone https://github.com/Umuzi-org/tech-department cd into the tech-department directory that was just created explore a little using git branch and git log type in git branch -a. This shows the remote branches try to checkout the branch called project/git-basic-excercises on your local computer. You can do it, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out how type in git remote -v  Going foward We just covered the basics here. Please make sure you understand this stuff. It\u0026rsquo;s super important. Git might seem like a weird theoretical thing to a lot of you. It might seem completely unrelated to the actual job of writing code. But it\u0026rsquo;s not. Git makes teamwork on dev teams possible. Without it we\u0026rsquo;d spend more time shouting at each other than writing useful code. So learn it. Be comfortable with it. When we start working in teams later on all will be made clear.\nIf you are curious now, spend some time googling git branching stratergies. We use the feature branching stratergy here. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover it in depth later on in the course.\n"

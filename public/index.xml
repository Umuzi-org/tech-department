      <description>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” ~ Martin Fowler
 You will be paired up with someone else. You will be expected to review each other&amp;rsquo;s code. This need not follow formal code review processes, you can just sit next to each other and chat if you want.
Any constructive feedback should be incorperated into the code.</description>

      <description>Product teams are teams of no more than 6 recruits guided by a product owner (Umuzi staff). The teams use the Scrum methodology to build real-world, web-based products. Recruits learn additional frameworks (e.g., Django) and packages as needed for the products.
An example of a current product is Umuzi’s online application process. In the past, Umuzi has used a combination of Google Forms and other, off-the-shelf, tools, to create an online application process for applicants.</description>

      <description>Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic HTML and CSS skills through free online platforms (currently FreeCodeCamp and Khan Academy). In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.</description>

      <description>The web dev short course is a short and intense introduction to full stack web development using modern JavaScript.
Course duration: 6 months. The last 2 months are an internship.
There is a lot of ground to cover so recruits will be encouraged to move forward with free code camp content whenever they have the time to do so. The FCC deadlines marked on this sheet are merely guidelines, ideally the recruits will be way ahead of the deadlines.</description>

      <description>There are a bunch of different test frameworks and test runners that Python allows. The main ones people tend to use are
 unittest pytest  These are both great tools with pros and cons. We have chosen to go with pytest for our course because of the lack of boiler-plate code. But don&amp;rsquo;t be scared of different frameworks!
Different testing tools have different ways of achieving similar goals. Make sure you understand why we test, what to test and when to test.</description>

      <description>Take Note This is a Test Driven Development Project. Please follow a test driven methodologies. That means that you write your test code first!
The basic idea of TDD is to write the test code before you write any actual code. So you write a test (which will fail) then you write the code that will make the test pass.
When you submit your code (on Github people!) then your tests MUST BE included in your code base.</description>

      <description>Once your dirst deadline is met you will have developed some opinions about what good (and bad) code looks like. And of corse the senior staff members have their own opinions.
In this session: Senior staff members will highlight a few common problems and some outstanding results. You will also each be given a chance to tell us something you learned.</description>

      <description>Implement the following user story on your code-review-buddy&amp;rsquo;s game:
As a user I want to be able to choose the dimensions of the grid each time I play the game. For example I might want to play on a 2x2 grid or a 3x2 grid.
Use Git! At this point you should be comfortable with using Git from the command line.
Make a Git branch for your new work and make sure to push your latest code atleast daily.</description>

      <description>How to submit your project Create a repo on github. The repo name should be: &amp;ldquo;umuzi-project-[the project description filename without the extension]&amp;ldquo;. Eg: if you are completing the project described in &amp;ldquo;basic-website-frontend-events.md&amp;rdquo; then you should name your github repo: &amp;ldquo;umuzi-project-basic-website-frontend-events&amp;rdquo;
All coding projects will be submitted as git repos. You are expected to use git properly, you will be penalised if you only have one gigantic commit or if your commit messages are nonesense.</description>

      <description>Make Umuzi Better (MUB) A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called Make Umuzi Better. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi&amp;ndash;anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.</description>

Create a class called Person which defines the generic data and functionality of a person. Now as we know there are a lot of things involved with a Person e.g (age,gender,their address, height, shoe size, passport number, etc). but in this case we are only interested in showing their name, age, gender, and interests, and we also want to be able to write a short introduction about them based on this data, and get them to say Hello.</description>

      <description>Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic python with an introduction to data management and visualisation with pandas, numpy and matplotlib. In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.</description>

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI
Data Assignment:
Write a script called factorial.py that takes a number and returns its factorial.
Steps: Think about which tests you want to do on that function. Write the tests first. Test an empty function called factorial - it should fail the tests Add code for returning the factorial of a number - it should pass for numbers &amp;gt;= 1 Add code for dealing with zero - should pass unit test for zero and for numbers &amp;gt;= 1 Add code for dealing with negative numbers Add code for dealing with non-numeric input</description>

      <description>The following videos use JavaScript to demonstrate and explain some key concepts around unit testing. Even if JS is not your vibe these are worth watching.
 Lesson 1: Why Unit Testing Lesson 2: Your first tests Lesson 3: Test Runners. This discussion on test runners mentions a bunch of JS stuff. But there are still many language agnostic concepts that are worth knowing about. Examples of Python test runners are unittest and pytest.</description>

Eg: if you are completing the project described in &amp;ldquo;basic-website-frontend-events.md&amp;rdquo; then you should name your github repo: &amp;ldquo;umuzi-project-basic-website-frontend-events&amp;rdquo;
All coding projects will be submitted as git repos. You are expected to use git properly, you will be penalised if you only have one gigantic commit or if your commit messages are nonesense.</description>

This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful. 

##Ground Rules
 In order to be efficient and productive we have some ground rules:
You are expected to be at your desk most of the time between *9am and 5pm (barring lunch)*

- Don't be late for workshops.
- Don't be late for standup.
- Don't be disruptive and noisy in the work area, this is a place for focus.

## Daily Tech Events.

These happen everyday and are compulsory for everyone to attend.

##### Stand up 
This is how we begin our day, announcements are shared and we discuss anything that hinders progress. 
 - Every morning at 09:00

##### Lunchtime presentation
*handled by Kii*
This is where we exercise our presentation muscle,  one recruit prepares a 5 minute  presentation about something tech related - what you’ve learnt, something you’re working on or any resources that you think might be useful. There is a [Schedule][ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zOvV2Tfk14IWyapA-hTAbeXrja3GYmP9sm4WPglr0qs/edit?usp=sharing] that specifies who will present on which day.   
- Everyday after lunch at 13:30, 

##### The Productivity Award
*Handled by Kii*
To encourage productivity, recruits are allocated points on a specific Criteria which comprises:
- Attendance 
- Project Submission
- Posting relevant material on Slack
- Asking and/or providing solutions to a problem posted on Slack
- Presentations
- Reviewing someone else’s code
- Doing useful pull requests
- Having your code merged.

Here's a link to the [Calendar] [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=dW11emkub3JnXzF1dGs1OWJuc2RqMDNpZDI3ZzlzZGJmb2EwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20]that all tech events are scheduled on. This is where yu will find dates for Workshops, Talks and Meetups. Check this everyday.



##### Tech Meetups
*Handled by Singi*

 At least once a month (usually more)  we attend a meetup. We get to learn on what's new in the tech world, learn more on the technology and languages we already know. Meetups are free, no cost to you. 
 
 Here's a link to the [Meetup Form for RSVPing] [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcIE6NU44zfybMsd_HhAU8eFM7LgIUQ5WXcJfe3KaPQgru4Q/viewform]  
 Use the form to RSVP for transport (which we provide).


## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:

##### Slack
This is the most important platform for communication. There are various slack channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

Make sure you check your slack atleast 3 times a day.

##### Emails
For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.
Check your emails atleast twice a day.

##### WhatsApp groups
For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### NCIT Material & Assessments
As you will be doing assessments for your National Certificate in Information Technology - Systems Development
The material and assessements are found on [Gnomio][http://umuzi.gnomio.com/]. This is where you will also submit these assessments


### Important Spreadsheets, Forms and Calendars (I suggest you bookmark these)
- [Coding & Data Programme Outline] [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14SsiRw8sit3-IvzpntINicIWd4MG1CDOxbv14Ypsmpw/edit?usp=sharing]
This spreadsheet is the source of truth, make sure to check it regularly. The tech staff updates the spreadsheet once per week, usually on Monday afternoon.

- [Code Project Submission Form] [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzgQRyS-duv3CSOtaTRv77U1ryLYb9l4uPkECktDe2nybpYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link]
This form is to submit your code projects which makes it easier for the facilitators and Senior managers to review your work.

- [Deadline Calendar] [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=dW11emkub3JnXzdtN3ZwOXQ1M2VubGk3YTVuODNtOWdpOWNvQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20]

make it clear that these will be peer-reviewed. And presentations will need to be made

this can probably be removed. Seemed utterly pointless the last time I was involved with it

projects/basic-flow-control-katas
add Java specific instructions. You should be doing this using Gradle and IntelliJ

---

projects/basic-flow-control-katas

topics/assertive_programming
This is a very useful thing. Basically litter your code with assertions, these make bugs into shouty errors. They also act as docs.
Easy in Python `assert sanity_condition, f"useful message with {context}"
Maybe useful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3269802/javascript-anti-silent-techniques-to-indicate-failure
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/assertions-in-java/
Suggest we do this before unit testing

projects/assertive_progamming
more level 1 katas, but this time assertions need to be used for sanity checking

---

projects/assertive_progrmming_with_pandas
maybe there should be a seperate one for DS. It can do things like make sure dfs have the correct dimentions and assert there are no duplicates and that sort of thing

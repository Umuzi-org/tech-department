# What You Need To Know

This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful. 

  

## Daily Tech Events.

These happen everyday and are compulsory for everyone to attend.

##### Stand up 
This is how we begin our day, announcements are shared and we discuss anything that hinders progress. 
 - Every morning at 09:00

##### Lunchtime presentation
*handled by Kii*
This is where we exercise our presentation muscle,  one recruit prepares a 5 minute  presentation about something tech related - what you’ve learnt, something you’re working on or any resources that you think might be useful. There is a schedule that specifies who will present on which day.   
- Everyday after lunch at 13:30, 

##### The Productivity Award
*Handled by Kii*
To encourage productivity, recruits are allocated points on a specific Criteria which comprises:
- Attendance 
- Project Submission
- Posting relevant material on Slack
- Asking and/or providing solutions to a problem posted on Slack
- Presentations
- Reviewing someone else’s code
- Doing useful pull requests
- Having your code merged.



##### Tech Meetups
*Handled by Singi*

 At least once a month (usually more)  we attend a meetup. We get to learn on what's new in the tech world, learn more on the technlogy and languages we already know. 
 



## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:
##### Emails
For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.

##### WhatsApp groups
For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### Slack channels
There are various slack channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

title: starting a new project with Gradle
ready: True
---

1. Open up IntelliJ
2. choose to start a new project
3. You'll be asked to choose between Java, JavaFX and a bunch of other things. Select Gradle
4. check the box that says "Kotlin DSL build script" (https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)
5. Press Next
6. On the next page of the wizard let's specify ArtifactId which basically is the name of our project. We can use the default information in the version field. Unless we plan to deploy our project in some Maven repository we don't need to specify a GroupId.
   7.Press Next
7. give your project a name (again. I know, it's a little odd)
8. click "Finish"
9. wait patiently...

You'll notice some spinning docnuts and words like 'syncing' showing up in your ide. IntelliJ is making sure you have the latest-greatest gradle installed

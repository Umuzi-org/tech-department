Title : The Tech Landscape Terminology
ready : true
---

The tech landscape is vast with interconnected technologies that comprise backend, frontend and database functionalities. These technologies vary, ranging from languages, frameworks, IDEs, databases and platforms.  

### Languages
A programming language is essentially a set of instructions given to a computer to produce various kinds of output. They are used to implement algorithms. Different languages have different syntax. In Web development, the frontend has 3 essential languages.

### Frameworks and Libraries
Frameworks and libraries are reusable code that has been written by someone else and packaged. They help save you time when coding as the main aim for them is to solve common problems that other developers have faced and solved. Most frameworks are open source, which means anyone can import them into their code and use them.

### Tools
A tool is a program that developers use to create, debug, maintain or support other programs and applications. These are usually simple programms that can be combined to accomplish a task. Some basic tools include source code editors, and compilers or interpreters. Tools are often excuted from the [command line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz7nYlnXLfE).

A tool that is widely used in development is Git [read more](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F), which is a version-control tool. It is used to track changes in the source code during the development process.


### Databases
A database is basically a structure that enables the storage, retrieval, manipulation and updating of data.

### IDEs
Integrated Development Environment(IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools that a developer needs to write and test code. An IDE can consist of a Text Editor (for writing the actual code), a debugger (to detect and fix errors) and code libraries (to make coding faster and easier). 

### Platforms
A platform is any hardware or software that is used to execute or host software, application or service. The most popular ones include Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

A widely used platform in Tech is Github [watch for more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E). It is a code hosting platform for version-control and collaboration. It is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect, upload and download resources. There are also alternatives to Github like GitLab, Bitbucket,Beanstalk and a whole lot others.

## Web Development 

Web development is the work involved in building websites, web apps and social media services, for the internet or private network (intranet). It can be broken down into specific specializations, namely: Frontend (Client facing side, Backend (server-side)  or Fullstack (specializes in both). Web development is like a machine and the specializations are like different parts of the machine. 

These parts have different technologies that comprise languages, frameworks, libraries and Databases and IDEs which make development possible.

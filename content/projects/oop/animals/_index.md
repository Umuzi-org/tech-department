In this challenge you will create 3 classes

1. Super Class called Animal
2. Dog and Cat class which both **extends** Animal class
3. Dog and Cat class should only have 1 function, which is their own implementation of the sound() function

```
dog = new Dog()
...
dog.eat() -> 'Rax eats'
dog.sounds() -> 'Dog barks'

cat = new Cat()
...
cat.eat() -> 'Stormy eats'
cat.sounds() -> 'Cat meows'
```

title: OOP Excercises
ready: true

Here are a few oop challenges for you. If you are new to OOP then it would make sense to do these in the following order:

- {{% contentlink "projects/oop/person" %}}
- {{% contentlink "projects/oop/dice" %}}
- {{% contentlink "projects/oop/bank_accounts" %}}

Please note: these excercises have no mention of frontend, gui, dom, html or any other stuff like that. You should be able to prove to yourself that your classes work just through use of unit tests. You should be able to interact with your classes from the command line.

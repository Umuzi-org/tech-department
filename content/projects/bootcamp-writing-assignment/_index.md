## We would like to get to know you better

We have a few questions for you. Please answer each of them in a seperate MARKDOWN file.

### What is markdown?

It's a seriously useful way of writing text files. A lot of software projects use it for documentation. It's built into Github as well.

This website you are looking at is generated from markdown files. Now is a good time to get used to it.

Have some links :)

- https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

To create a markdown file just create a file with the extension `.md`. That's it.

If you are using ACode on your android device, you can press the "play" button in the editor and your markdown will get rendered as a website.

If you are running vscode you can right click on a markdown file and select "open preview" to see what your work looks like.

### Why?

There are a few reasons:

1. We want to get to know you :)
2. A lot of people dont really sit down and think about what they are trying to do in the long run. It's a really useful excercise

### The questions

Please create a separate file for each of these. Remember to pay attention to your sentence structure, spelling and grammar.

#### 1. Your history [200 - 500 words]

Tell us about your personal history. Who are you? Where do you come from? Feel free to include some interesting facts.

#### 2. Why do you want to be a coder? [100 - 300 words]

What is it about this career path that attracts you? What inspired this decision? Why did you apply for the specific course you applied for? Some of you applied for web development, some of you applied for data science - why did you choose what you chose?

#### 3. Your free time [ <= 300 words]

How do you spend your free time? You can just give us a list of things you like to do. Some people like to excercise, watch movies, read... what do you like to do?

#### 4. Relevent experience [ <= 300 words]

Do you have past experience that you think will be relevant? Maybe you learned to code in school, or built something cool already. Maybe you've even written code for money before. Maybe you taught yourself some stuff.

If you haven't got relevant experience, don't worry! We're all about giving people opportunities to gain experience.

#### 5. What makes you think you'll succeed as a coder? [<= 300 words]

What makes yuo think you have what it takes? What traits or attributes do you have that will be useful in this setting? Maybe it's past experience? Maybe you have an IQ of 203. Maybe you are good at asking questions.

#### 6. What might get in the way of your success? [<= 300 words]

The courses offered here are hard - a lot of people struggle for lots of different reasons.

What weaknesses do you have that might stand in the way of your success? And what strategies do you have for overcoming these challenges? And do you need help?

#### 7. Your routine

Please tell us how you think you'll structure your days in order to get your work done.

Also, the course is pretty much self-paced. So the faster you move the better things can be (so long as you understand)

- Some people work best in the early hours of the morning. Some people work late at night.
- Some people work on weekends
- some people put in more than 40 hours per week because they just love this stuff, or because they want to get a job sooner
- And of course different code schools have different requirements

#### 8. Your future

If you succeed and get a high value career in your chosen field, what do you think your life will look like? Do you have personal goals? How will this effect your family and your community? Is there a big problem you want to solve? Or a business you want to start?

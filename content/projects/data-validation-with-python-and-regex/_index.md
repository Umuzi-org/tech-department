#### Python regex
*Regular Expression(regex):* A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

*Python Module:* Regular expression operations

*Usage:*
```py
import re
```

Read the Regular Expression Operations Documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), learn enough to know what regex is and to know how to go about regex-ing. You can also checkout some more material on YouTube, Google, DuckDuckGo, your choice.

title: Tilde Mockups
---

Tilde is pretty cool and stuff, but it still needs a lot of work. This is your chance to make your mark!

In this project you'll get to pick one of the upcomming Tilde features and write a frontend that demonstrates the look and feel.

Your objective is not to make a fully functioning full stack web application. Your goal is to create a Mockup. If your mockup is suitably kiff then we'll put it into Tilde :)

## Technologies in use:

- use `create-react-app` to set up your app
- [material ui](https://material-ui.com/): we are already using this a lot
- To get your site to be responsive, make use of [The material ui Grid component](https://material-ui.com/components/grid/)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/): This is something that our data scientists are quite familiar with - it's good to be consistant about out use of technologies in order to allow easy cross-functional communication. So if you draw any graphs look here first

## What does success look like?

- Demonstrate knowledge of React by making multiple components
- Make use of Material UI
- Your frontend should be intuitive for users. Try to empathise with the user. What will they want to see? Where will they be confused.
- your website needs to be responsive. Make us of the
- make sure you follow good architectural practices

## What does excellent look like?

If you make use of state and props in order to demonstrate interactions then that would be pretty darn cool. But first make this thing look good.

## General procedure

1. Draw pictures of what you want to build. This will help you refine your thinking. They dont need to be super beautiful or anything.
2. Show the pictures to people and get feedback. Refine your thinking. Shew your stuff to other recruits, or to other people who are involved in whatever program/process you are trying to improve on.
3. Build a mockup

## Ready, set, go!

Now it's up to you. You can choose one of the following. Or if you think of something else that you would like to do, make a suggestion. Tilde is for you guys so if there is something you want to see, tell us about it!

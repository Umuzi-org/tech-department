## Instructions

Create a Memory game MVP. Requirements:

- make use of simple dom elements, no fancy graphics needed or canvas stuff
- a single player can play the game
- no time limit (for the player. You, on the other hand have a deadline to meet)
- board is a pre-defined size
- board allows one set of symbols to be randomly hidden

## Submission process

- Make sure you follow good coding practices, your code should be readable. Your code should be in a git repo with a sensible name. You should push your latest code to your repo before you leave the office every day.
- once you are done with the basic game then please communicate this fact to your managers by emailing them your submission.
- You will be expected to demonstrate your basic game

## Note

This project will be multiple phases. We will ask you to implement different features over time. We will also mix things up a bit and get you to implement features on other people's games. So be kind to your colleagues and write clear code!


- You will be reviewing each other's code. We will tell you who to review. Please take the code review process seriously, it's a great way to learn about good practice and teamwork
- Incorperate your reviewer's feedback into your code
- Your game code will then be reviewed by an Umuzi staff member
- we will then have a workshop in which we go over any common mistakes and highlight anything excellent
- we will communicate all the dates involved

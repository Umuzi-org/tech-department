You will be paired up with someone else. You will be expected to review each other's code. This need not follow formal code review processes, you can just sit next to each other and chat if you want.

Any constructive feedback should be incorperated into the code. By the end of this process each game should have fewer bugs (if there were any to begin with) and be generally more human-readable. 

Each of you should take note of what you learned in this process. 

- what makes code easy to work with
- what makes code hard to work with
- any weird bugs or inefficiencies that could hae been avoided
- notable technology choices
- anything else? 

## note

Be kind and respectful, even when giving feedback on cray-cray spagetti code. This process can be frustrating and it can be painful to hear people critisize your work. Just remember, the point of this process is to learn.

## submission

Check on slack

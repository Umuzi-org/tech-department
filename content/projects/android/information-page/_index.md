The goal of this project is to create a page containing multiple forms of media that has to do with a place
the student may decide on.

# Note

- The app can be about a restaurant, an event or anything similar.
- The app must only consist of a single activity and a single layout file.
- All media must have something to do with the place in question.

# Project description

The following must be part of the application:

- A header with the name of the selected place.
- A text description that is longer than a single line.
- An image of the place or of the logo.
- An audio clip describing the place.
- A video clip of the place in question.

# Bonus question

If you feel up to the task, add media control functionality to the audio clip and the video.

- Allow a user to play and pause the media with a button click.
- Allow the user to skip to a time of their choice in the audio clip.

AndroidTrivia - starter code
============================


Introduction
------------

The AndroidTrivia app asks the user trivia questions about Android development.
It makes use of the navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between
screens. Each screen is implemented as a fragment.

The app navigates using buttons, the app bar, and a navigation drawer. Because
students haven't yet learned about saving data or the Android lifecycle, the app
tries to eliminate bugs caused by configuration changes.

Prerequisites
-------------

You need to know:
- The fundamentals of Kotlin.
- How to create basic Android apps in Kotlin.
- How to open, build, and run apps with Android Studio.
- How to work with layouts.

Getting started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.

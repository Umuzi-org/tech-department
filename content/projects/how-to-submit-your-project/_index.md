# How to submit your project

Create a repo on github. The repo name should be:
"umuzi-project-[the project description filename without the extension]". Eg: if you are completing the project described in "basic-website-frontend-events.md" then you should name your github repo: "umuzi-project-basic-website-frontend-events"

All coding projects will be submitted as git repos. You are expected to use git properly, you will be penalised if you only have one gigantic commit or if your commit messages are nonesense.

There should be a clear README that describes how to launch your program. Maybe a script needs to be run, maybe an index.html needs to be opened in a browser. Tell us what we need to do.

Once your code is all neat and tidy in git then post a link to the #project-submissions channel on slack.

# TODO:

should we use older cohorts to review code before we do? It'll be good practice for them but might effect deadlines

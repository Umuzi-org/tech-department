title: 'Tilde project tutorial: How to submit a link'
---

There are a few kinds of projects you can do and they can be submitted in different ways. In this tutorial you'll see how to submit a link.

Link projects expect you to submit a link to your work. If the instructions say you need to make a repo, then you'll need to submit a link to your repo. If the instructions say you need to use Google Docs then you need to submit a link to your document.

## Start the project

If you have not yet clicked the "start project" button for this card, do so now. You'll see the card move to In Progress.

Now explore the card. Click on the details button and see what's there.

## Instructions

In this project you'll be submitting a perfectly useless Google Doc.

1. Go to https://docs.google.com/
2. Choose to start a new document
3. Give it a title, for example "Perfectly useless doc"
4. Write some text. Whatever you want. Preferably something hilarious
5. Click the Share button
6. You'll need to copy the available link. Make sure that sharing is set up so that anyone with the link can access the document!
7. Now in Tilde, go to your card and fill in your link

Alrighty. Once you are satisfied that your card is linked to the right document then you can request a review. When you request a review you are basically saying "I have followed the instructions and I think that my work is competent or excellent".

The card will then pop across to the "Review" column. We'll talk a little bit more about how review works in a little bit.

## Common problems

Whenever you attach a link to a card, you need to make sure that whoever is reviewing your work can actually access the link.

- if we ask you to link to a github repo, make sure the repo is public and not private
- if we ask you to link to a google document or sheet, make sure that anyone with the link has access
- if we ask you to link to absolutely anything, you need to make sure we can actually access your work.

The other common problem is people deleting their work. Once we have reviewed your work it is super duper important that you don't change the privacy settings or delete it. We do interact with external assessors (that is why we are accredited!) so if we say a student is competent in something and we can't prove it then that's bad. In these cases we would expect you to redo the work.

**So seriosly, dont delete stuff that you have submitted!**

(Except maybe this perfectly useless doc. If you want. Because it actually is useless)

title: Predict survival on the Titanic
ready: True

## Instructions

Use a logistic regression model to find the factors that were most important in predicting survival on the Titanic.

1. Load the [train](train.csv) and [test](test.csv) datasets.
2. Get basic descriptive statistics for the training data and check for missing and incorrect values. Replace missing values if this makes sense to do.
3. What are the factors that predict survival? (i.e. which variables significantly predict survival, *p* < 0.05)
4. Create a classification report and confusion matrix of predicted and observed values. What is the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model on the (a) training and (b) test data?
5. Plot a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve on the test data.
6. What is overdispersion?

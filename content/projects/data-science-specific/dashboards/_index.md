## Assignments

There are several assignments on this page for you to try. The first two create dashboards using Plotly, a static and a dynamic real time data update. 

The Google Data Studio is an optional, static dashboard. This assignment has a slightly sharp learning curve on setting up, uploading data and structuring the data, but once that is done, it is relatively easy.

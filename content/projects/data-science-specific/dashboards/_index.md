## Assignments

There are three assignments for you to try. Two of them create dashboards using Plotly, one uses static data, while the other one uses dynamic real time data. 

The third one is a Google Data Studio project which also uses static data. This assignment has a slightly sharp learning curve on setting up, uploading data and structuring the data, but once that is done, it is relatively easy.

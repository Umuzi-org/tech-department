Use [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and regular expressions (regex) to scrape the data of provincial dam levels from the [Department of Water and Sanitation](http://www.dwa.gov.za/Hydrology/Weekly/SumProvince.aspx).

Create a dashboard with graphs showing the current and previous week's dam levels by province, and compare it to the water levels from the previous year. Your dashboard should update weekly (in other words, you can't just copy and paste this week's data to your notebook).

### Think about
- What type of graph will show this information best?
- Do all graphs have clearly understandable headings, axis labels and (if applicable) legends?

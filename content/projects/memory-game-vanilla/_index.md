Here is an example of a memory game: http://dkmgames.com/memory/pairsrun.php

## Instructions

Create a Memory game MVP. Requirements:

- Take a moment to google MVP. If you add unnecessary features we'll ask you to remove them
- make use of simple dom elements, no fancy graphics needed or canvas stuff
- a single player can play the game
- board is a pre-defined size
- board allows one set of symbols or images to be randomly hidden

Build your game in a TDD manner. If you don't include tests in your final submission you will be held back and you will be expected to start over.

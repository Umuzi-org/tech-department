The projects in this section are designed to really test your skills. You need to talk to your manager before moving forward with this project.

You get to choose which project you want to do, but your manager has to be ok with your choice. If you choose a project that is inappropriate for whatever reason then your manager will be allowed to tell you to do a different one. Your manager might even insist that you do two projects. Consider yourself warned ;)

Please look over all the available projects and see what looks most interesting, then set up a discussion with your manager.

## Before you begin coding

Write out a markdown file that will explain your architectural decisions and your plan of action for how you will achieve this task.

For example if you need to write a full stack app then maybe you need to design a database, develop some apis, design a cool looking button for your frontend. What specific tasks do you think you'll need to do?

Commit your markown file to your repo and get it reviewed and merged in the normal way.

If everyone is efficient with their code review then this will go quickly.

Your manager will also need to review your plan of action once it is merged. Please poke them if needed. It's very important that a senior person looks at your plan. Because good planning is a superpower.

Add tests

Once the recruits have finished this section they will be competent React developers. They will be able to build apps to a certain level of complexity.

Understand and demonstrate the fundamental concepts
Basic React architecture: React is very powerful but allows a person to write some proper spaghetti code.
Unit testing your React app
Making requests form react (ajax): this is needed for React to communicate with a backend
Frontend storage options: Localstorage etc

Redux:

This is when things start getting tough. If a recruit can get through this then they will be able to build apps with many moving parts. Redux seems like a complication at first but it adds a lot of sanity to complex projects. It lets you scale.

Foundational concepts. What is it? What problem does it solve? Recruits will start off by developing a redux application that has nothing to do with React. Once they understand redux by itself we can bring everything together
Data structuring: eg: flat is better than nested
Integrating Redux into your React app
Architectural patterns and tradeoffs, deep dive into the three ducks pattern
Redux Thunks for accessing backend services

Redux Sagas

Foundational concepts. Sagas versus thunks
Api calls like a boss
Lots and lots of practice

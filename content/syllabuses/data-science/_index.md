# Data Science Programme Summary

Using computer science and applied statistics, data scientists find valuable patterns where other people just see noise. Harvard Business Review says Data Scientist is "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century," and we agree. It’s a rare combination of interesting challenges and high-value opportunities. Data skills are a superpower, and with great power comes great job responsibilities. Our data scientist learn basic mathematics, programming, data extraction and manipulation, and data analysis and interpretation skills.

## Prerequisites
- English literacy
- Matric maths (not maths literacy)
- No specific technical prerequisites, except a strong aptitude for coding and statistics, as well as a strong motivation to challenge oneself and learn new things, assessed through Umuzi’s rigorous application process
Ability to work in an agile, human-centred way.

## Duration
- 160 hours of training in HCD and Agile through the Umuzi workshops and crash course
- 1360 hours of subject-specific, technical training over 8 months at Umuzi proper
- 3 months of full-time work experience with Umuzi’s world-class employer-partners

## Cost
- 100% free for learners
- Learners receive a stipend for living costs
- Employer partners sponsor the training costs and stipends

# Data Science Curriculum

Data Science Track
Data Science: Job Description
Using computer science and applied statistics, data scientists find valuable patterns where other people just see noise. Harvard Business Review says Data Scientist is "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century," and we agree. It’s a rare combination of interesting challenges and high-value opportunities. Data skills are a superpower, and with great power comes great job responsibilities. Our data scientist learn basic mathematics, programming, data extraction and manipulation, and data analysis and interpretation skills.

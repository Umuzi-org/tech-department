We support a few different technical learning paths. Data Science, Data Engineering and Web Dev. What follows below is a week-by-week breakdown of these courses. This is all on one page because our various courses have enough in common that it makes sense to keep then synchronized.

## A note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation

Umuzi is a registered training provider with NCIT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognize their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements. Below we refer to the formal NCIT requirements e.g. NCIT01: Business and technology.

## Terminology

This is a living document and there are a few things that need to be fleshed out:

- as far as possible each bullet point that describes a piece of our syllabus should be marked as a WORKSHOP, TOPIC or PROJECT. Or excercise??

  - WORKSHOP == instructor led event.
  - TOPIC == self study material
  - PROJECT == you know
  - EXERCISE == like a project but no deliverable. Something the recruits should do to practice on their own

- every topic, workshop and challenge needs to be linked to in this document
- we need to make sure all the NCIT requirements have been dealt with before hitting the summative assessment
- this doesn't account for MUB so well. MUB should happen sometime...
- the syllabus is really long. There is a lot to cover so that has effects on Product teams. There are decisions to be made there.

## Potential MUB assessments

We might be able to get some of out NCIT assessments out of the way during MUB.

- NCIT 03: Conducting research and user interviews
- NCIT 04: reporting
- NCIT 05: Research presentation
- NCIT 14: Pseudocode and documentation (might be pushing it a bit here)

## Week 0: Bootcamp

This is the final step of our interview process. If applicants get through the bootcamp then they are accepted as Umuzi recruits and go on with the rest of the program.

We start off by introducing the applicants to the development environment and resources that they'll be using. Then they get to work.

- WEB_DEV:
  - Use [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). Start off with JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)
  - JS challenges are given
- DATA_SCI:
  - Introduction to Jupiter notebooks
  - [DataCamp intro to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
  - visualization challenges
- DATA_ENG:
  - introduction to Python (resource to be selected)
    - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/?utm_source=learnpython_com&utm_campaign=learnpython_tutorials#

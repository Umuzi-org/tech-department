Motivation
Junior data scientists complete the programme mostly focussing on tools and techniques for experimentation such as Jupyter notebooks, Google Datastudio, Dash and Plotly. They create dashboards mostly using Dash and Plotly to generate insights for use in designing better experiments in the data science projects. They have an in-depth understanding of machine learning principles, but lack an in-depth understanding of building dashboards and machine learning web applications for integration into software products. Django being a popular ubiquitous Python Web framework, it is an efficient way for data scientists to master techniques on building scalable, end-to-end data-driven solutions for dashboards, predictions and recommendations solutions for business insights.

Transferable skills:
Python
Plotly
Deep dive into database access with ORMs
Database structuring
Database versioning
Architectural concerns of a data-driven full stack web application
Syllabus Summary
Python foundations
Basic syntax and concepts (new concepts related to web applications)
Some advanced tools: decorators and generators
Unit tests and mocks in Python

Django foundations
All concepts needed to make a full stack web application in Python
Data structuring and visualisation in complex applications
Database management with Migrations and git

Authentication and authorisation
Advanced use of ORM, and when it falls short
Advanced concepts in testing
ETL tricks
Rapid development of REST apis using Django Rest Framework (DRF)

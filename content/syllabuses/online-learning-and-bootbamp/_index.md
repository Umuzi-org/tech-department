## Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp
During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic python with an introduction to data management and visualisation with pandas, numpy and matplotlib. In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.

During bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuziâ€™s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning, presenting the results of their work at the end of the bootcamp. In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of teamwork challenges to learn how they communicate within a team and work under pressure; as well as individual tasks to assess ability to follow instructions, control impulsive reactions and plan actions. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.

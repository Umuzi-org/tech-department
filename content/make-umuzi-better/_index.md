A recruitâ€™s journey includes a three-week programme called #MakeUmuziBetter (MUB). Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi - anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.

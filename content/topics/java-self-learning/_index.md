You are expected to spend your free time learning and practicing your Java development skills. Here are some resources for you. Different people tend to prefer different resources because they support different styles of learning.

- [Java Syntax guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-syntax) This is just a reference, it doesn't explain absolutely everything
- [Code Gym](https://codegym.cc/): You are a young robot who is learning some Java from some insensitive aliens...
- [Head First Java](http://ikucukkoc.baun.edu.tr/lectures/EMM3115/Head_First_Java.pdf): This book is nice because it is thorough and weird. It's not one of those boring text books. Unfortunately this book is a bit old so not all of it is appropriate:

  - outdated and useless JUST SKIP
    - Ch. 17 - last half of the chapter teaches Java Web Start(This was deprecated in Java 9, we’re on Java 11 at the time of me writing this)
    - Ch. 18 - Part of this chapter talks about RMI, absolute legacy that you’ll only find in systems that are 15 - 20 years old.
  - Parts that are outdated but not useless
    - Ch 12 -15 - These chapters teach a small amount of Java Swing (quite outdated) to build projects. They are still full of useful information because the point is not to teach Swing, but to learn about Java core and just use Swing to make a very simple GUI. The Swing that you learn is quite minimal.

- [Core Java Volume 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/Core+Java+Volume+I%E2%80%94Fundamentals,+Eleventh+Edition/9780135167199/preface.xhtml#preface). This is up to date with Java 11.

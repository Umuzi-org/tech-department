This document contains content and timing 

Time allocations and content 

You’ll notice that the content below is divided up into 2 major sections. Soft skills and Hard skills. The idea is that you will be completing these two tracks in parallel. 

40% of your time will be dedicated to the soft skills content (until it is complete) - this is equivalent to 2 days per 5 day work week. 

60% of your week will be dedicated to the hard skills content - this is equivalent to 3 days per 5 day work week

Once you are finished with the  soft skills content then you’ll focus 100% on the Hard Skills component. Please complete the content in the order presented here.

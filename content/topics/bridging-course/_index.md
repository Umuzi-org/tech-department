###  Bridging Course


The content below is divided up into 2 major sections. Soft skills and Hard skills. The idea is that you will be completing these two tracks in parallel. 

Once you are finished with the soft skills content then you’ll focus 100% on the Hard Skills component. Please complete the content in the order presented here.

### Soft Skill Content

Learning how to learn: This is a meta-skill. If you value learning and do it effectively then life is just better.

Time estimate: 6 hours

#### Communication is a super power. 
If you want to advance in your career then you’ll need to effectively communicate with stakeholders (or your boss), and chances are you’ll be working in a team. Written communication is a big deal! Get good at it!

#### Cognitive biases.
 You’ve heard of software bugs, right? Well, human minds also have bugs. People often make the wrong decisions even when they have all the information they need to make the right ones. This has been studied by very clever people. Read about cognitive biases and try to spot them in yourself and the people around you.

The attention economy is a thing. If you want to be happy and successful then you need to pay attention to the things that make you happy and successful.That seems pretty obvious but it’s often not so easy.

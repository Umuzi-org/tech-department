We use wireframes as a feedback technique; before building any sort of digital solution we put a basic wireframe (an outline or a map) of the solution in front of a user to get feedback before we start building. 

A great wireframing program is Invision: https://stratsumuzi.invisionapp.com/freehand/KimmyB-XxDWOBDiA Here is an example of wireframes the c19s drew up for an external client. 

Wireframes are an essential part of the process of developing a digital solution, they enable techies to see what they are building towards, while aiding us in getting good user feedback. You can even use paper wireframes to interview potential users: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10JaL0O6rckm_iblDp14GUgLeHvkhvxQQKjWLv7KrZjs/edit

title: Brainstorming / Ideation
ready: true

Often during the process of creating (products, services or solutions) we are quick to ideate and come up with a range of weird and whacky ideas. Design Thinking allows us to focus first on understanding our users' context (empathise) and then ensuring that we have defined the right problem (define) and only after these stages have been completed can we move on to the ideate stage. In this manner we ensure that we're thinking of ideas for the right audience and the right problem. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocAiZIFE1deLJmN33bxtKYtchRyPasnj75nzRKnP38g/edit

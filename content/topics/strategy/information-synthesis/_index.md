title: Information  Synthesis
ready: true

Design Thinking is a convergent-divergent process, where our ideas and focus can broaden (diverge) and narrow (converge) depending on the phase of the process we're in. Information Synthesis is a tool we use to converge our ideas and context into an insight statement. In this way we are able to focus on the problem we are trying to solve. This is called the Define phase, as we are drawing up a 'How Might We' statement to define exactly where and how we need to add the design solution. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyKx1sY_5WiT8Y5enW8C2R9khTg5_HXX5TMN6VFaYSI/edit

Improving user experiences requires that the analyst understand the process the user goes through and expose pain-points and system flaws. Umuzi recruits can draft user journeys and use them to identify problems in order to improve experiences and products. 

How recruits learn the skill and associated tools:
Recruits learn user journey mapping through internal workshops hosted by their department manager. The workshops combine theory and practice. The theory introduces concepts and definitions followed by a discussion to digest the content. Once the theory is done recruits are presented with a slice of our recruitment process and tasked to draw a user journey on it; the “as is” and a “to be”.

Practice of the skill and associated tools:
When the skill has been learned it is continually applied by the recruits throughout the learnership when working with user processes. 

A useful tool is the MUB facilitators guide, here you'll find tips on how to map a user journey (and other helpful tricks) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JGiYZjvm3g_4H6cbLWxYSmXpZt6G9Me7kMO0YHsfFzA/edit?usp=sharing

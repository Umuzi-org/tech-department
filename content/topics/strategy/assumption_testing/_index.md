title: Assumption Testing & Rapid Prototyping
ready: true 
--- 
Inherent in any solution there will be assumptions about how our users will respond to it as well as the delivery, environment, the solution's robustness etc. In order to make our solution more robust we need to test the assumptions on which we have built the idea. We then will pivot or perservere based on the feedback from our design solutions. During the Prototype and Test phase of design thinking we will put 'cheap and nasty' versions of our solution in front of clients and build tests to see how our assumptions hold up. We err on the side of making the prototype a Lo-Fi version of the solution so that we don't invest a lot of resources into creating the solution before we've tested the assumptions.

Design Thinking (Human Centered Design) is a project management framework that underpins how we work at Umuzi, a good understanding of Design Thinking will stand you in good stead in industry. The key concepts include, human centricity, iteration, prototyping and feedback. 

There are five phases in Design Thinking. They are: empathise, define, ideate, prototype and test. 

1. Empathise - here the idea is to get into the shoes of the user you're serving https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oTTDPUf6pEUyx6ZiQ5GUJr2o3m-aA2sszw7oP8cphks/edit 
2. Define - defining the problem well is key, working to solve the wrong problem can be problematic to say the least! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyKx1sY_5WiT8Y5enW8C2R9khTg5_HXX5TMN6VFaYSI/edit
3. Ideate - coming up with wild and whacky ideas to bring about the best solutions for the user https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocAiZIFE1deLJmN33bxtKYtchRyPasnj75nzRKnP38g/edit 
4. Prototype and Test - it's key to get your ideas in front of a user quicky to get their feedback, prototype the smallest iteration for quick feedback

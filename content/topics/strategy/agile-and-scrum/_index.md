ready: True 
---

Agile and Scrum are a method of managing projects that introduce flexibility, continual feedback collection and smaller task groups. It minimises the risk of project failure and allows organisations to experiment and learn in a cheap way.  Learning this framework we will constantly challenged you to apply it to your work at Umuzi. 

Here's how to apply agile to a software environment: https://www.edx.org/course/agile-software-development

We've taken the time to write up this useful introduction to project management: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZ_j-wWpGEPmbWdDwtU5MHfhC-4n2XxWHGsmyXc_NgY/edit#

## How you learn the skill and associated tools:
Agile and Scrum are taught early in our program as part of the crash course. This material is developed collaboratively internally at Umuzi by professionals with industry experience in strategy, consulting and business management.

You'll also find really helpful stuff (agile manifestos and such) here... https://umuzi-org.github.io/tech-department/topics/agile-scrum/ 

## Practice of the skill and associated tools:
Practice of the skill is done throughout the program where recruits apply it on the recruitment department and helping our tech departments in managing their projects and teams. During the programme they also use associated tools such as Trello.

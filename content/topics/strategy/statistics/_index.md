Basic statistics are helpful in equipping you with important skills that  enable you to draw accurate conclusions and insights from data; the skills include data collection, data analysis, principles of data visualisation and making good probability estimations. It's a huge bonus if you're a strat and you can work well with numbers ;) 

A useful way of working through these is to ask a manager to have a session with your cohort once you've completed each link and to go through the specific excersizes you have struggled with (you can also help each other out)

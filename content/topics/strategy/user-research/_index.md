The ability to properly unserstand the user's perspective when creating a product/service or design solution is key to creating solutions to problems that work best for the user. In Design Thinking when researching into the user's experience we call this the Empathise phase. Here we learn about how to see the world through the eyes of the user. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oTTDPUf6pEUyx6ZiQ5GUJr2o3m-aA2sszw7oP8cphks/edit 

One of the biggest advantages in using Design Thinking is continuous user feedback. Throughout the process of creating a business model, a product, a service etc. seeking input from the user is essential to building a solution the user wants. In the Prototype and Test phase of Design Thinking, we will again seek rich, detailed feedback from users. https://docs.google.com/document/d/10JaL0O6rckm_iblDp14GUgLeHvkhvxQQKjWLv7KrZjs/edit#heading=h.ovawxtt4jb2

Mock Interviews are done so to give you a glimpse of what you can expect from a real
life interview. This is a great way to prepare you of what is to come.

The Mock Interviews also invlove the following as we try to make it as real life as possible.

#### Whitebording
Basically this is when the interviwer asks the interviwee to solve some code challenges  on a whiteboard 
right there and then.Also in explaining the code,we get more information about their coding skills.

#### Code Tests
Companies often want to see what you can or cannot do and code tests are valuable for that reason.
Normally they dont expect juniors to get 100% but to get a better understanding of their skills.


#### Technical questions
These are questions that are specific to the role that the Junior is going to be filling.
It helps interviewers see if the candidates know what the job inloves and if they can fulfil the role.


#### Talking about experiences and portfolio
This is a very important part as it is a visual representation of the skills that a recruit/jumior has.
Most companies ask for example for a link to the candidates repo to see their work.


#### Soft skills and culture fit 
This is basically to see if the interviewee is going to be a good addition to the company.
These involve also getting a glimpse of their values and behaviours to certain things.

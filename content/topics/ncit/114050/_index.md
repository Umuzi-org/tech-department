## Fundamental business concepts

### Business Types
To make the most of your business goals and for legal purposes it is important to understand the different types of businesses you can be registered as. Depending on the nature of your software company and the game you will be designing you might consider the following 5:


1. Sole Proprietorship

2. Partnerships

3. Corporation

4. Nonprofit

5. Cooperative


#### 1. Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is the simplest of business types and therefore also the most popular. It is a business that's owned by just one person where there isn't any legal or financial distinction between the business and the business owner.


**The Positives**

 - Minimal forms and legal procedures to declare this type of business

 - Low start-up costs

 - Greatest freedom from regulation

 - Owner in direct control of decision making

 - Tax advantages to owner

 - All profits to owner


**The Negatives**

 - Unlimited liability: owner is fully accountable for all of the profits, liabilities and legal issues that the business may encounter

 - Limited access to specific licenses and other documents

 - Difficult to raise capital

 - No continuity if anything happens to the owner


#### 2. Partnerships (General and Limited)
A partnership is appropriate if your business is owned by two or more people. In a general partnership all members share the management of the business and each is personally liable for all the debts and obligations of the business. A limited partnership, or LP, is an off-shoot version of a general partnership, and is the most common for those looking for investment.


With an LP, there are two sets of partners:


1. 3 General partners: usually involved in the everyday business decisions, and have personal liability.

2. Limited partners: typically investors. Not liable for debts and don't partake in regular business management.


In either type of partnership, you will be required to:


1. register your business with your state and establish an official business name.

2. obtain a business license, along with any other documentation that your state office can help you with

3. register your business for tax


**The Positives**

 - Additional sources of investment capital

 - Low start-up costs

 - Possible tax advantages

 - Limited regulation

 - Broader management base


**The Negatives**

 - More legal documentation required

 - Unlimited liability: general partners are fully accountable

 - Lack of continuity because business is attached to owners

 - Divided authority

 - Hard to find suitable partners

 - Possibility for conflict between partners


#### 3. Corporation
A corporation, is a fully independent business (when public) that's made up of multiple shareholders who are provided with stock in a new business. The corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, the shareholders. Most common is what's known as a "C Corporation," and if you currently work for a company with multiple employees, that's likely the business structure they're using. Most likely, if you're starting off as a smaller business, particularly one that only operates online, declaring yourself as a corporation wouldn't be appropriate. But if you truly are a corporation, you'll need to file very specific documents with the state, followed by obtaining the appropriate business licenses and permits.


**The Positives**

 - Limited liability: owners are not accountable for the business, it a separate legal entity

 - Ownership is transferable and therefore the business has continuity

 - Possible tax advantages

 - Easier to raise capital

**The Negatives**

 - Closely regulated

 - Most expensive to set up

 - Extensive record keeping necessary

 - Double taxation of profits (eg. corporate tax and personal income tax)

 - Potential conflict between shareholders and executives


#### 4. Nonprofit
As the name suggests, this is an organization that's not seeking a financial profit, but promotes educational or charitable purposes. Money earned must be kept by the organization to pay for its expenses. There are several types of nonprofits available, many of which can receive "tax exempt" status. This process requires filing paperwork, including an application, with the government for them to recognize you as a nonprofit organization.

#### 5. Cooperative
This is a business that's fully owned and operated for the benefit of the members of the organization that use its services. Cooperatives sell shares to cooperative "members," who then have a say in the operations and direction of the cooperative itself and whatever is earned by the cooperative is then distributed among the members themselves. The main difference in the process of becoming a cooperative, as opposed to the other types of businesses listed, is that your organization must create bylaws, have a membership application and have a board of directors with a charter member meeting.


Some basic questions to help you define your business type:


 - How many people are in your software company?

 - Do you plan to hire people in the future?

 - Is your game for profit or does it a have a purely social objective?

 - Do you feel comfortable accepting full responsibility for the success or failure of the game?


### Business Aims & Objectives
All businesses have aims or objectives. It can be useful to be clear about what these are from the beginning. They will help determine the type of business you create and structure its growth and development. In a real life situation knowing these aims and objectives will help you do the following: find partners, create a budget, apply for funding and outside investment.

### Common Business Objectives
#### Survival
A short term objective, probably for small business just starting out, or when a new firm enters the market or at a time of crisis

Example: Pay yourself a salary

#### Increase Profitability
This could be for the owners and shareholders or it could also be to increase the financial resources of your company for future expansion

Example: Save profits to invest in future game improvements

#### Customer Satisfaction
Ensure that the users of your product or service are happy with what you are providing. This can create loyalty and lead to a more successful product in the future

Example: Increase user membership

#### Increase Market Share
This is often done in order to allow a company to grow and therefore increase profits and influence in the market. Increasing market share can be achieved through advertising, researching target markets, analysing competition, then strategically placing, pricing and promoting the company’s product or service.

#### Optimising Productivity
This could be for future expansion or to improve your product and services. This might be achieved by: expanding and improving resources eg. office space, computer equipment; or making sure staff are happy; or employing more skilled staff.

Example: Add a new feature every 6 months



### Pro-Social Objectives
Since the company you are creating will have a positive social impact it is worth also thinking about objectives that are not only concerned with profit and growth:

#### Innovation
Placing resources into research and development to create a new product, or into offering a better service. Innovation also helps a business stay ahead of the competition.

Example: Conduct a customer survey and respond to results

#### Ethical Values
You might choose objectives which are based on how one should treat the environment or animals.

Example: Source your materials locally to reduce carbon footprint

#### Public Services
This could be about ensuring the well being of less fortunate people or groups without access to a particular service.

Example: Develop initiatives to create a broad and diverse user base


TODO: Provide a real world example

### Effective Business Objectives
The most effective business objectives meet the following criteria:


**S - Specific -** objectives are aimed at what the business does, e.g. a hotel might have an objective of filling 60% of its beds a night during October, an objective specific to that business.

**M - Measurable -** the business can put a value to the objective, e.g. €10,000 in sales in the next half year of trading.

**A - Agreed -** by all those concerned in trying to achieve the objective.

**R - Realistic -** the objective should be challenging, but it should also be able to be achieved by the resources available.

**T- Time -** specific They have a time limit of when the objective should be achieved, e.g. by the end of the year.


Remember business objectives can change over time. For example:


 - Survival in the first year may lead to an objective of increasing profit in the second year.

 - The competitive environment might change, with the launch of new products from competitors.

 - Technology might change product designs, so sales and production targets might need to change.




#### Creating Your Aims & Objectives:


**What is your aim?**

Where will this business go in the future, what are its goals. It is a statement of purpose.

What are your objectives?

These are stated, measurable targets of how to achieve business aims.


**What is your mission statement?**

This sets out the business vision and values that enables employees, managers, customers and even suppliers to understand the underlying basis for the actions of the business.


### Business Environments

A business environment is the combination of internal and external factors that influence a company's operating situation. The business environment can include factors such as: clients and suppliers; its competition and owners; improvements in technology; laws and government activities; and market, social and economic trends.

#### Internal vs External Environment
While the internal environment is usually under the control of the business and will include: objectives, policies, production methods, organisational structure etc. The external environment includes all those factors which exist outside and aren’t in direct control of the business. These include: customers, suppliers, competitors, the public, and trends.


#### Online Gaming Industry
You will need to research the online gaming industry in order to understand the external environment you are working in and design your business accordingly so it will succeed. You might consider some of the following factors which were taken from market research done in 2017:


**Mobile Gaming**

“Mobile games currently hold the largest segment of the industry’s revenue. By the end of 2017, they are expected to have generated $46B, which makes up 42% of the global market for game products. For comparison, console games will make up 31%, and PC/Desktop games only 27%.”


**Virtual Reality**

“Virtual Reality is another promising stream of revenue, with analysts predicting a growth of 104% from 2016 to 2017. In fact, by the year 2020, the annual worldwide revenue for VR is expected to reach $28B, which is 6 times more than what it’s expected to be this year. Granted, only about $4.5B will come from actual VR games, but that’s still more than 20 times what gamers spent by the end of 2016.”

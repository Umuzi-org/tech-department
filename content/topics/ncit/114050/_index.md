## 1. Fundamental business concepts

### Business Types
To make the most of your business goals and for legal purposes it is important to understand the different types of businesses you can be registered as. Depending on the nature of your software company and the game you will be designing you might consider the following 5:


1. Sole Proprietorship

2. Partnerships

3. Corporation

4. Nonprofit

5. Cooperative


#### 1. Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is the simplest of business types and therefore also the most popular. It is a business that's owned by just one person where there isn't any legal or financial distinction between the business and the business owner.


**The Positives**

 - Minimal forms and legal procedures to declare this type of business

 - Low start-up costs

 - Greatest freedom from regulation

 - Owner in direct control of decision making

 - Tax advantages to owner

 - All profits to owner


**The Negatives**

 - Unlimited liability: owner is fully accountable for all of the profits, liabilities and legal issues that the business may encounter

 - Limited access to specific licenses and other documents

 - Difficult to raise capital

 - No continuity if anything happens to the owner


#### 2. Partnerships (General and Limited)
A partnership is appropriate if your business is owned by two or more people. In a general partnership all members share the management of the business and each is personally liable for all the debts and obligations of the business. A limited partnership, or LP, is an off-shoot version of a general partnership, and is the most common for those looking for investment.


With an LP, there are two sets of partners:


1. 3 General partners: usually involved in the everyday business decisions, and have personal liability.

2. Limited partners: typically investors. Not liable for debts and don't partake in regular business management.


In either type of partnership, you will be required to:


1. register your business with your state and establish an official business name.

2. obtain a business license, along with any other documentation that your state office can help you with

3. register your business for tax


**The Positives**

 - Additional sources of investment capital

 - Low start-up costs

 - Possible tax advantages

 - Limited regulation

 - Broader management base


**The Negatives**

 - More legal documentation required

 - Unlimited liability: general partners are fully accountable

 - Lack of continuity because business is attached to owners

 - Divided authority

 - Hard to find suitable partners

 - Possibility for conflict between partners


#### 3. Corporation
A corporation, is a fully independent business (when public) that's made up of multiple shareholders who are provided with stock in a new business. The corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, the shareholders. Most common is what's known as a "C Corporation," and if you currently work for a company with multiple employees, that's likely the business structure they're using. Most likely, if you're starting off as a smaller business, particularly one that only operates online, declaring yourself as a corporation wouldn't be appropriate. But if you truly are a corporation, you'll need to file very specific documents with the state, followed by obtaining the appropriate business licenses and permits.


**The Positives**

 - Limited liability: owners are not accountable for the business, it a separate legal entity

 - Ownership is transferable and therefore the business has continuity

 - Possible tax advantages

 - Easier to raise capital

**The Negatives**

 - Closely regulated

 - Most expensive to set up

 - Extensive record keeping necessary

 - Double taxation of profits (eg. corporate tax and personal income tax)

 - Potential conflict between shareholders and executives


#### 4. Nonprofit
As the name suggests, this is an organization that's not seeking a financial profit, but promotes educational or charitable purposes. Money earned must be kept by the organization to pay for its expenses. There are several types of nonprofits available, many of which can receive "tax exempt" status. This process requires filing paperwork, including an application, with the government for them to recognize you as a nonprofit organization.

#### 5. Cooperative
This is a business that's fully owned and operated for the benefit of the members of the organization that use its services. Cooperatives sell shares to cooperative "members," who then have a say in the operations and direction of the cooperative itself and whatever is earned by the cooperative is then distributed among the members themselves. The main difference in the process of becoming a cooperative, as opposed to the other types of businesses listed, is that your organization must create bylaws, have a membership application and have a board of directors with a charter member meeting.


Some basic questions to help you define your business type:


 - How many people are in your software company?

 - Do you plan to hire people in the future?

 - Is your game for profit or does it a have a purely social objective?

 - Do you feel comfortable accepting full responsibility for the success or failure of the game?


### Business Aims & Objectives
All businesses have aims or objectives. It can be useful to be clear about what these are from the beginning. They will help determine the type of business you create and structure its growth and development. In a real life situation knowing these aims and objectives will help you do the following: find partners, create a budget, apply for funding and outside investment.

### Common Business Objectives
#### Survival
A short term objective, probably for small business just starting out, or when a new firm enters the market or at a time of crisis

Example: Pay yourself a salary

#### Increase Profitability
This could be for the owners and shareholders or it could also be to increase the financial resources of your company for future expansion

Example: Save profits to invest in future game improvements

#### Customer Satisfaction
Ensure that the users of your product or service are happy with what you are providing. This can create loyalty and lead to a more successful product in the future

Example: Increase user membership

#### Increase Market Share
This is often done in order to allow a company to grow and therefore increase profits and influence in the market. Increasing market share can be achieved through advertising, researching target markets, analysing competition, then strategically placing, pricing and promoting the company’s product or service.

#### Optimising Productivity
This could be for future expansion or to improve your product and services. This might be achieved by: expanding and improving resources eg. office space, computer equipment; or making sure staff are happy; or employing more skilled staff.

Example: Add a new feature every 6 months



### Pro-Social Objectives
Since the company you are creating will have a positive social impact it is worth also thinking about objectives that are not only concerned with profit and growth:

#### Innovation
Placing resources into research and development to create a new product, or into offering a better service. Innovation also helps a business stay ahead of the competition.

Example: Conduct a customer survey and respond to results

#### Ethical Values
You might choose objectives which are based on how one should treat the environment or animals.

Example: Source your materials locally to reduce carbon footprint

#### Public Services
This could be about ensuring the well being of less fortunate people or groups without access to a particular service.

Example: Develop initiatives to create a broad and diverse user base


TODO: Provide a real world example

### Effective Business Objectives
The most effective business objectives meet the following criteria:


**S - Specific -** objectives are aimed at what the business does, e.g. a hotel might have an objective of filling 60% of its beds a night during October, an objective specific to that business.

**M - Measurable -** the business can put a value to the objective, e.g. €10,000 in sales in the next half year of trading.

**A - Agreed -** by all those concerned in trying to achieve the objective.

**R - Realistic -** the objective should be challenging, but it should also be able to be achieved by the resources available.

**T- Time -** specific They have a time limit of when the objective should be achieved, e.g. by the end of the year.


Remember business objectives can change over time. For example:


 - Survival in the first year may lead to an objective of increasing profit in the second year.

 - The competitive environment might change, with the launch of new products from competitors.

 - Technology might change product designs, so sales and production targets might need to change.




#### Creating Your Aims & Objectives:


**What is your aim?**

Where will this business go in the future, what are its goals. It is a statement of purpose.

What are your objectives?

These are stated, measurable targets of how to achieve business aims.


**What is your mission statement?**

This sets out the business vision and values that enables employees, managers, customers and even suppliers to understand the underlying basis for the actions of the business.


### Business Environments

A business environment is the combination of internal and external factors that influence a company's operating situation. The business environment can include factors such as: clients and suppliers; its competition and owners; improvements in technology; laws and government activities; and market, social and economic trends.

#### Internal vs External Environment
While the internal environment is usually under the control of the business and will include: objectives, policies, production methods, organisational structure etc. The external environment includes all those factors which exist outside and aren’t in direct control of the business. These include: customers, suppliers, competitors, the public, and trends.


#### Online Gaming Industry
You will need to research the online gaming industry in order to understand the external environment you are working in and design your business accordingly so it will succeed. You might consider some of the following factors which were taken from market research done in 2017:


**Mobile Gaming**

“Mobile games currently hold the largest segment of the industry’s revenue. By the end of 2017, they are expected to have generated $46B, which makes up 42% of the global market for game products. For comparison, console games will make up 31%, and PC/Desktop games only 27%.”


**Virtual Reality**

“Virtual Reality is another promising stream of revenue, with analysts predicting a growth of 104% from 2016 to 2017. In fact, by the year 2020, the annual worldwide revenue for VR is expected to reach $28B, which is 6 times more than what it’s expected to be this year. Granted, only about $4.5B will come from actual VR games, but that’s still more than 20 times what gamers spent by the end of 2016.”

Some starter questions to help you understand your business environment:


 - Who is your target audience? What kind of games are they playing? What devices do they have access to?

 - What kind of games are successful software companies making?

 - What resources do you have to create your game and will they limit you?

 - How will you distribute your game, will there be limitations?

## 2. Systems theory and information systems

### Systems Theory
Systems theory is a broad and abstract way of understanding how interrelated and interdependent parts work together as a whole. It can be applied to a wide range of disciplines including business studies. In particular, we will be focusing on information systems and how we can most effectively organise information to ensure the smooth running of a business.

### Concept and Theoretical Components

The two videos below will introduce you to the systems theory and how it can be applied to organisations:


**Introduction to systems theory:**


{{< youtube GRnkggRSIDY >}}

**Systems theory in organisations:**


{{< youtube 1L1c-EKOY-w >}}

### Information Systems

Businesses tend to have several information systems. For most businesses, there are a variety of requirements for information for successful running:


 - Senior managers need information to help with their business planning

 - Middle management need more detailed information to help them monitor and control business activities

 - Employees with operational roles need information to help them carry out their duties


It may be that as a sole proprietor that you take on all these roles but you will still need to think about how you record and monitor the different areas of your business.

#### 1. Transaction processing systems (TPS)
TPS serve people in the operational level of an organization. These might be: billing systems to send invoices to customers, systems to calculate the weekly and monthly payroll and tax payments or task management systems.


*The development of a game or piece of software, especially a large one, can require the work of multiple departments and multiple projects over a long period of time. For a lot of software companies a core part of the day-to-day operation will be an Agile Project Management system to manage tasks and keep on top of projects. This approach to task management can be useful also to small businesses. Many other systems that manage day-to-day administration (for example of human resources or financial accounting) will be managed by digital web apps that work together. These are especially useful to small businesses that don’t have many resources or capital.*

#### 2. Knowledge management systems (KMS)
KMS exist to help businesses create and share information. They are typically used in businesses where employees create new knowledge and expertise, which can then be shared by other people in the organisation to create further commercial opportunities. KMS are built around systems which allow efficient categorisation and distribution of knowledge.


*In the process of creating a game, you might have ideas that need to be maintained and shared. These might be contained in word processing documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, internet pages, etc and shared using group collaboration software like Google Drive. More specifically, code development can be a messy business, especially if you’re collaborating. In order to make sure everyone has the latest versions and file structure you will use a version control system (GitHub).*

#### 3. Management information systems (MIS)
These are primarily concerned with internal sources of information and serve the management level of the organization. MIS usually take data from the transaction processing systems (see above) and summarise it into a series of management reports. MIS reports tend to be used by middle management and operational supervisors.


*For example, budget and project (programming/design) reports might be created to keep track of the development of your game.
*

#### 4. Executive support systems (ESS)
Designed to help senior management make strategic decisions. An ESS gathers, analyses and summarises the key internal and external information to get the overview of the entire organization’s performance.

 

*For a small startup software company, this might involve pinpointing key measurable areas of your business, analysing them every 3-6 months, and adapting your business objectives accordingly.*



**Some questions to make you think about how you will organise your business:**


 - How will you organise and share your ideas?

 - What tools will you use to develop your game?

 - What combination of webapps will you use to manage your projects? Do they work well together?

 - How will you manage your time and keep to deadlines?

 - Where will you keep track of your finances?

## 3. Using IT in business

### Information Technology in Business

Information technology (IT) is all about storing, manipulating, distributing and processing information. Over the past 15 years it has transformed businesses with innovative technological tools and replaced conventional modes of business. In addition to the increased output and efficiency, IT has introduced new concepts such as e-commerce.


Online gaming would not be as sophisticated or as popular without the constant advancements taking place in IT. The following are some key ways in which IT has transformed business:


#### Productivity/Data Management
Online and offline technological applications (eg. word processing, spreadsheets, cloud computing) have increased the productivity of businesses and eliminated the time consuming process of manual document management.

#### Monitoring
IT can be used for monitoring areas of the company that are not utilizing resources efficiently. For instance, automated digital reports on employee time management, task completion and customer engagement analytics can quickly inform and support strategic decision making.

#### Communication
For many companies, email is the principal means of communication. Over the years, a number of other communications tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems (Slack, Skype, etc).

#### Marketing and Customer Relationship Management
Businesses can maximize their commercial advantage by making the right use of IT channels and tools. Social media, digital distribution methods and personal computing devices have changed the way that customers engage with products and services. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems capture every interaction a company has with a customer, so that a more enriching experience is possible.

#### E-commerce
E-commerce is the is buying and selling services and goods over the Internet. With the worldwide rise of personal computing devices, it has grown exponentially. Online operations reduce the time and personnel required for business processes and many services are now distributed and used exclusively online.


#### E-commerce and Online Gaming
E-commerce is especially relevant to the online gaming industry which could be described as an e-commerce platform. Online games are sold, distributed and used by customers online. The internet already offers many different models for this kind of business and as it keeps developing there will inevitably be more. Here are a couple to think about:


 - Membership (monthly payment) based games

 - Unlimited access games (one-off payment)

 - In-app purchase games

 - Free games (financed by advertising)

## 4. Information needs for a business

### Data & Information

**Data**

Data is raw, unorganized facts that need to be processed. Data can be something simple and seemingly random and useless until it is organized.

**Information**

When data is processed, organized, structured or presented in a given context so as to make it useful, it is called Information.

### Information in Decision Making

Decision-making is the most important task of managers in an organization. Therefore, to enable managers to make good quality decisions, it is very important to provide them with the right kind of information. Information management systems are therefore very important. In the context of a new business it is especially important as it helps in responding to your business environment and making sure your business survives and develops.


#### Systems and tools to help decision making
We looked at systems that inform decision making in the Information Systems section. As we saw in the previous section, most modern organizations use IT systems for information management. Many of these computer based information management systems will be called Management Information Systems (MIS) and help managers take informed decisions. Though computer based technology is not necessary, it helps to provide timely and accurate information in a competitive environment.

#### Stages of decision making
Using the information provided by the above systems, decisions can be divided into the following stages:


1. Identification and structuring of problem/opportunity (Empathise)

2. Putting the problem opportunity in context (Define)

3. Generation of alternatives (Ideation)

4. Choice of best alternatives (Prototyping)


Each of these steps will involve analyzing information and might even involve gathering more.


### Data Integrity & Security
As personal computing becomes more accessible, popular and even necessary for day-to-day living and working, the amount of personal and sensitive information we store online is increasing. As a result, it is also vulnerable to the flaws of our information technology systems.

#### Data integrity:
Data integrity can be compromised in a number of ways:


 - Human errors when data is entered

 - Errors that occur when data is transmitted from one computer to another

 - Software bugs or viruses

 - Hardware malfunctions, such as disk crashes

 - Natural disasters, such as fires and floods

#### Security:

 - Physical theft

 - Internal/employee sabotage

 - Industrial/Political espionage

 - Malicious code/hacking


Governments and international organisation are increasingly recognising the importance of data protection and are developing legal frameworks. You too must make the protection of your users’ data (especially passwords and payment information) a priority.


### Information Subsystems

Systems Theory, as applied to organizational management, puts forth the premise that all organizations are systems, and all systems are part of larger systems. How a subsystem fits the needs of the larger system ultimately determines if that subsystem prospers or is left to wither on the vine.

It’s this concept that the adept leader can use to get a more “holistic” view of his organization. Understanding how the company relates to the larger system in which it exists and operates, and then how the company’s internal systems contribute or detract from that larger relationship can provide a more relevant analysis.

5. Data Science for Business (Data Track Only)
This material is best viewed at this website:

https://data36.com/data-science-for-business/



Doing Data Science without a sense of business is like playing chess without the kings on the board. For every business, making its products or services better is the ultimate goal of a data science project. Leaving that out of the picture is nonsensical.

Your data team could feature the best coders and the best statisticians, but if they don’t know the actual business application of their data projects, the whole thing will be pointless.

The business data science mindset
Did you notice that I wrote that the goal is to improve the quality of the product or service and not to generate more profit? This doesn’t mean that you won’t make more money because of your data science projects. I rather want to highlight the priorities.

On a high level, you can achieve two things with data science.

#1 Understanding your audience better. Learning about their needs, their struggles, their motivations, their habits and their relationships to your product or service.

#2 Using this understanding to create a better product or service and turning that into profit.

The order is important.

Your number one priority should be to help your users. As a consequence of that, your product or service will flourish. And that better product or service will bring you more users, more returning users and eventually more revenue.

the business data science mindset
If you like this mindset, you will like this article. If not, then maybe it’s not for you.

Note: I wrote this article mostly for online businesses. If you are not running an online business, you can still make the analogies and apply the things you learn here to your own specific use case.

A data science project step-by-step
From data to information – and from information to better decisions
At its core, (almost) every data project plays the same role in your business. Data science helps you make easier, faster and better decisions.

As simple as it sounds as complicated it can get in real life.

Let’s take a look at the typical six steps of a data science project:

Data Collection
Data Storage
Data Cleaning
Data Analysis
Communication, data visualization
Data-driven Decision
business data science
the typical six steps of a data science project
Every step has its own challenges. Let’s go through them one by one so I can show you the major challenges you should be aware of at each step – to prevent or solve them.

(1) Data Collection – where many businesses fail already
“Garbage in, garbage out.” – as the well known data principle says. And it’s true.

Too many data projects fail at this very first step. Too many companies collect incomplete, unreliable data and everything they do after that… is just messed up.

Real story from a real company: we were doing an A/B test as the last phase of a 2-month comprehensive study. It was a complex experiment, with many funnel steps and webpages included. It should have run for 30 days to collect enough data points for a statistically significant result…

The only problem was that around the end of the second week of the experiment, a freshly hired junior developer removed one of our tracking codes from one of the webpages we tested. (He said he didn’t know what the code snippet did, so he deleted it. I was fuming. I still am when I recall this story.)

The point is: we realized only at the end of the 30-day test period that the code was removed. Even though it was only one minor subpage (the issue caused an estimated ~5-10% data discrepancy), we had to trash the whole A/B testing project and restart it from day one because half of the experiment was based on skewed data.

The worst thing in this story was not that we had to re-run an A/B test – but that we could never trust our data again. We always had to double-check and triple-check everything before we made conclusions. And that slowed us down for months.

The moral of the story is: proper tracking and data collection is crucial for every business doing data science. My specific recommendation is to have at least one person in your team who’s responsible for data collection and who double-checks everything to do with it at least once a month.

What to collect?
I get many questions about what to collect and what not to collect. I’ll get back to this in detail in an upcoming article. My general answer until then: it depends on many things. 

At the companies I’m working with, we almost always do workshops to figure out what we need to collect and how.

The general idea is to collect everything you can – because data storage is relatively cheap nowadays.

business data science data collection example
v0.1 draft from a data collection specification
But you have to keep in mind that the more things you track on your website:

the more engineering time you should allocate to implement and maintain tracking
the slower your website or application will be (we are talking about microseconds here – but it can add up easily)
the more complex your data infrastructure becomes
and so on…
Note: also consider legal and ethical aspects!

(2) Data Storage and (3) Data Cleaning – automate it and don’t forget to maintain it
Data storage and data cleaning are the responsibility of data engineers. It’s a highly technical job but usually you don’t have to worry about it too much. Not that it’s easy or unimportant. It’s just that it’s a well-defined job, so when you hire a (good) data engineer, she will know exactly how to take care of this part of your data business. There are not too many pitfalls. Plus, a big part of it can be automated, so it’s very convenient.

Although this is not a major threat for your business, I have a story where a (data scientist) friend of mine came to his office in the morning, opened his laptop… And realized that they had just lost around 40% of their historical data overnight.

I was in their office that day, and I can tell you: I’ve never seen data engineers that stressed. Ever. (By the way, the problem was an unexpected software update that caused an important data cleaning script to break.)
Luckily, they were smart enough to prepare for this event and they had backups of their historical data on other servers. 

Still, this spotlights very well that data storage and data cleaning is a project that you should continuously maintain — and a place you should be prepared for “crisis situations,” too.

Big Data
One more thing about data storage… This is the right place to talk about “big data.”

It’s a common buzzword in business data science. Many books have a catchy title featuring “Big Data.” Many journalists are using it in thinkpieces. Many managers like to say it…

Dan Ariely put it right:

“Big data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it…” 

DAN ARIELY
What really is big data?

First of all, it’s a technical concept.

Let me add another story to explain what it is. (It will also help you figure out when you need it.)

At a startup I worked with, we had around ~100,000 users when we first set up our automated data cleaning and analytics scripts. A few scripts ran every midnight, and when we arrived at the office, the updated numbers had automatically been added to the company dashboards.

All very nice and clean.

However, the company grew fast.

Fast forward 2.5 years: we had ~10,000,000 users (that’s 100 times more users), much more complex data logs (because we wanted to collect more detailed data), many more automated data scripts (because we wanted to monitor more things)… in one sentence: our data servers had to deal with an exponentially and continuously growing workload.

Until one day, we got to the office and our new daily numbers didn’t show up on the dashboards. We took a look at the scripts — and they were still running. Even though we used a very powerful (and expensive) server to do all the computations and our scripts were written to be very efficient, they ended up running for more than 10 hours.

And that’s when big data technologies come into play. The concept of big data is to connect more than one computer to manage all these computations. Depending on your company (and data) size, it can easily be a cluster of 10, 100 or even 1000 computers. Sounds easy, but under the hood, using big data can be very challenging from a technical standpoint. 

business data science - hadoop architecture
Example: an older version of a popular big data solution (Hadoop HDFS) explained visually.
Anyway, that’s what big data is in a nutshell.

Again: it’s highly technical and if you hire good (big) data engineers, they will know what to do. 

Note: if you want to learn more about the technical part, the keywords you want to google are “apache spark” and “apache hadoop”.)

(4) Data Analysis – extracting value
This is where business data science gets exciting – for business people at least.

A data analyst is a sculptor. 
She gets a block of data and then she carves and carves until she gets something truly special.

And it’s a creative process, indeed.
I’m a data analyst at heart and I know from experience that when you have an ocean of data in front of you, it can be very intimidating.
Often, you don’t know where to start.

But there are a few guidelines that can help. Here are the top three that helped me:

1. Good questions.
To get useful answers, you have to ask the right questions. That usually comes from the management (or other colleagues), who already have suspicions based on their experience.

In this case, a data analyst’s primary job is to prove or disprove these suspicions (let’s call them hypotheses). 

Note: A common misbelief is that disproving a hypothesis is a step backwards. People are looking at it as the failure of an idea… That’s the wrong mindset, though. When a good data analyst proves or disproves an idea, she discovers many new things throughout the process, so she can offer one or more alternative solutions that are better than the original idea.

Let me also emphasize the good in the phrase “good question.” Answering bad questions sets back a data project significantly. Bad questions can be:


Unimportant questions (“What happens if we change the logo size by one pixel?”)
Questions that aren’t business related.
Vague questions (“How do people like us?”)
Or questions that we don’t (and won’t) have data to answer.
2. Qualitative research.
Often, when I don’t know where to start with my data analysis, I go to the UX department of the company I’m consulting for and take a look at their usability test results. Also, I really like to sit in on usability tests (or watch the recordings). 
There is nothing like seeing a real user interacting with your product. Watching just 5-6 UX tests will give you at least 10-20 ideas for where to start your analytics project.

3. Best practices. 
Now that I’m a more experienced data analyst I know quite a few data analysis techniques that it’s worth starting my research with.
It really depends on the given data project and on the specific business use case. 
But at online businesses I usually start my discovery process with a funnel analysis, a segmentation or a retention analysis project. (More about this in later articles.)

If you start with business analytics today
If you start with data science for your business today, I’d recommend focusing on one specific thing before you do anything else.

That’s finding your single most important metric.

You’ll find as many names for this as there are books on the subject:

OMTM – One Metric That Matters (by Croll & Yoskovitz)
WIG – Wildly Important Goal (by McChesney & Covey)
North Star Metric (by Sean Ellis)
Etc.
Different names, same point:

You have to figure out your single most important metric.

And you should place this metric above every other metric you have — measure it and keep it as your main focus.

A good most important metric is:

simple (so everyone at your company understands it immediately)
measurable (so it’s an actual number)
describing your business goals really well (so it actually matters) 
and…
There is only one of it! (Yes, I know, it’s hard to find one metric. But it’s possible — and once you have it, it will be very useful!)
(Note: Actually there are a few more factors that make a good main metric… but let’s try to meet these four conditions first!)

Let’s take the simplest example: a mature e-commerce business.

What makes the best number one key metric for an online e-commerce business that’s been operating for more than 10 years?

Of course, it’s revenue! Why? Because it’s simple. (Profit, for instance, would be much harder to calculate and understand for everyone at your company.) It’s easy to measure. It reflects on the company’s business goals. And it’s one single metric. Perfect.

The situation is simple for mature e-commerce businesses. At other businesses (e.g. early phase startups, more complex business models, etc.), it can be much harder to figure it out. For many of my clients, finding the single most important metric takes multi-hour-long internal workshops.


workshop time – figuring out most important metrics
But so far everyone has been able to find it. So can you!

(5) Data Communication – data and information translated for business people
This is the step where most data science projects fail.

Interesting, isn’t it?

You can be the best analyst working with the finest data set in the world… But if you can’t communicate your findings efficiently, you will have zero impact.

That’s the nightmare of every data professional.

There are quite a few roadblocks here. And I’ve seen all of them: data-sceptic (or simply stupid) co-workers, over-complicated presentations, unreadable charts…

The fact is that everyone at your company needs to be involved in order to build a culture where people can communicate and use data.

I have two specific recommendations for you:

Educate! 
Data professionals should hold presentations every week – not just about their recent findings but also about why data science is important for the company. Start with things like what a data analyst does, how the data science business works, how colleagues can build self-serving data solutions for themselves, and so on.

Business people should educate data scientists, as well. They should help them to create and deliver better presentations. I’m really grateful for the companies I worked with, because they sent me to presentation trainings regularly. Plus my managers also sat down with me to review my presentation before I presented it to the whole company – so we could make sure that I really nailed it on stage. It helped a lot for everyone.

Keep it simple.
Everything about your communication should be as simple as it can be!
No fancy scientific words (you don’t want to show off),
no complicated charts (you don’t have to show everything),
no infinite emails (you want people to read what you write).
If you can show your data-driven takeaways in one line chart and explain them in one sentence, you should do it. Everyone will be happy about it.

Note: I wrote more about data presentation principles in this article: Presentation Tips for Data Professionals.

(6) Data-Driven Decision Making – why are data-driven managers important?
Have you ever heard the acronym “HIPPO”?

It stands for highest paid person’s opinion… and it was a well-established business decision-making method for decades…

Thanks to data science, it’s not the case anymore.

However, not every manager is ready for this to change. Even a very well-executed data project can (and will) fail at this point, just because you hurt someone’s feelings or ego. I know this sounds bad but this is the inconvenient truth. (Especially at larger companies with 500+ employees.)

You can prevent this by establishing a data-driven company culture early on.(I usually recommend to start to think about your data strategy when you have 10-50 employees.)

At a bigger company, it will be exponentially harder to make your organization data-driven.

It’s also important to send your managers to data workshops and make sure that they develop the right mindset.

Business Data Science = Compressing 10 billion data points into one “yes” or “no”!

the six steps of an online business’s data science project
Can you see how it’s all about compressing the infinite amount of data into a single yes-or-no decision?

It’s like distilling the essence from a meadow of flowers.

It takes hard work but it’s rewarding in every sense.

If you manage to collect the right data and use it well, you will be able to make better decisions more quickly and more easily. That will lead to a better product, happier customers and eventually more revenue.

And that’s what business data science is all about.

The 3 Major Data Science Business Applications
I want to talk a little bit more about STEP (3) Data Analysis, because it’s a very broad topic.

There are so many opportunities to turn your data into value.

More specifically, at online businesses, these are the three most common practical applications of data science:

(A) Business Analytics (aka Descriptive Analytics).
It answers the questions of “what has happened in the past?” and “where are we now?”
(E.g. reporting, measuring retention, finding the right user segments, funnel analysis, etc.)

(B) Predictive Analytics
It answers the question, “what will happen in the future?”
(E.g. early warning (predicting which user will cancel her subscription next month), predicting the marketing budget you will need in the next quarter, etc.)

(C) Data-Based Product
A product that works using your historical data.
(E.g. self-learning chatbots, recommendation systems, image recognition, voice recognition, etc.)

Which one of these brings the most business value?
To answer this question, your keyword is:

ROI – Return on Investment.

From a purely business perspective, data science is an investment of your resources, and you want to have some sort of return on it.

The question is: which project of the above three brings the biggest value for your business right now?

Business analytics? Predictive Analytics? Or developing a data-based product?

It’s an open question and one to which only you know the answer. But here’s a common pattern I see from my clients all the time.

Everyone is very excited about predictive analytics, machine learning and data-based products (like chatbots). Yet, many of these companies:

don’t have a clear funnel (that they measure step-by-step)
don’t know too much about their key metrics (not to speak of their most important metric),
don’t have clear numbers on their important user segments
heck, sometimes they don’t even know how many users (or paying users) they have
and so on…
These are all (A) business analytics and descriptive analytics questions.

And until you know the answer to these questions (and other simple but important business questions), you should not go for machine learning projects yet.

If you recognize yourself, my strong recommendation is: invest in business analytics and simple reports first. By answering the basics, you will generate tremendous business value: you will see more clearly and you will understand your audience better.

And who knows, maybe by learning your audience’s needs, you will map out a user-need for an image recognition system in your product, and in a few months (when the business data science fundamentals are already set) you can start to work on that, too.

Calculate return on investment, and go for the simpler data science projects first!

Conclusion
Summarizing everything, your business data science project will have six major steps:

Data Collection
Data Storage
Data Cleaning
Data Analysis (here you can work on business analytics or predictive analytics projects — or on data-based products)
Communication, data visualization
Data-driven Decision
All these steps come with unique challenges, and all together they build up into a complex system. This article gave you a few practical tips and tricks — but you will learn the big picture and put everything in context when you start to build up your own data infrastructure.

It’s a difficult project but it will bring you value on every level: better product(s), happier customers and more revenue!

title: Introduction to gnomio and NQF
---

Umuzi's certifications are nationally recognised. This is pretty awesome, but it does mean we have to jump through a few hoops. Basicaly we need to give external assessors access to some of your work. For now we do that using a platform called Gnomio.

Here's the deal: You'll be given access to gnomio and there will be an assessment there for you to fill in.

It is very important that:

- you read and follow instructions
- you do your absolute best on the assessment - try get it as close to 100% right as you can
- you ask for help if you get stuck
- pay attention to any deadlines set out
- you submit your own original work! The external assessors are pretty sharp, if they catch you copying each other then that will be a big problem. Make sre that you don't copy people. Type our your own answers in your own words!

Here's a video of Loki explaining it all:

{{< youtube RaaBrPCo_Mw >}}

#### Definition of Scrum

Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is:

 - Lightweight

 - Simple to understand

 - Difficult to master

Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts (documents), and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrumâ€™s success and usage.

The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive. These strengths continue operating in single, several, many, and networks of teams that develop, release, operate and sustain the work and work products of thousands of people.

#### Scrum Values

When the values of **commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect** are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum events, roles and artifacts.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

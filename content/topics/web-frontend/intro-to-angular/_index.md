<a href='https://angular.io/' target='_blank'>Angular</a> is an opensource <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_framework'>Javascript Framework</a> used to build <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page' target='_blank'>dynamic mobile and desktop web applications</a> using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript' target='_blank'>TypeScript</a>/JavaScript and other languages.

<b style='text-decoration:underline'>History</b>
<br/>
In 2012 Google introduced a new Javascript Framework called <a href='https://angularjs.org/' target='_blank'>AngularJS</a>, the framework was written using pure Javascript and deloveloped using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller' target='_blank'>Model-View-Controller</a> concept. The framework uses HTML as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor' target='_blank'>templating language</a> by extending <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp' target='_blank'>HTML attributes</a> with <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_directives.asp' target='_blank'>directives</a> and linking the data to HTML with <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_expressions.asp' target='_blank'>expressions</a>, this makes possible quick development of dynamic webapps with source code that is easier to read, understand and maintain. Here is a simple implementation of AngularJS on a webpage <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/angular/tryit.asp?filename=try_ng_intro' target='_blank'>here</a>.

AngularJS is also known as Angular 1, in the following years after AngularJS was released google and the opensource community released a second version of AngularJS but they called it Angular 2, the suffix 'JS' from AngularJS was removed and this has been so even now with the <a href='https://angular.io/guide/releases' target='_blank'>latest version</a> of angular released being version 7. Angular 2 was a re-design of AngularJS not an increment of it, Angular 2 apps/code is not backward compartible to AngularJS apps/code, but they do share some of the concepts and philosophies except Angular has had more improvements and features added to it, while angularJS has remained at version 1.

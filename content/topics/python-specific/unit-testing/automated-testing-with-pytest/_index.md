title: Automated Testing in Python

There are a bunch of different test frameworks and test runners that Python allows. The main ones people tend to use are

- unittest
- pytest

These are both great tools with pros and cons. We have chosen to go with pytest for our course because of the lack of boiler-plate code. But don't be scared of different frameworks!

Different testing tools have different ways of achieving similar goals. Make sure you understand why we test, what to test and when to test.

If you end up working on a project that uses unnittest instead of pytest then use unittest. Eg: Django projects are traditionally tested using unittest instead of Pytest so there is a bunch of cool Django tooling around that, which is totally fine.

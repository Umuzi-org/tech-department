Download and install miniconda on your machine. This will install python 
and and the conda package manager for python. Make sure that you set the 
python path. Setting the path will allow you to simply type 'python' 
into the terminal to open python.

You also want to install the following packages:

- jupyter-notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- scikit-learn

You can install packages by typing `conda install name-of-package`, e.g. 
`conda install numpy`.

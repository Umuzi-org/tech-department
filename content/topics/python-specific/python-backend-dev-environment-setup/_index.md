### What you need

This page is here to help you get set up on your local machine. These are are very important tools we use at Umuzi and eventually at the workplace.

#### Installations

Setting up your environment needs you to to install a bunch of stuff. A good programmer knows his stuff, knows what he's installing and doesn't just jump into code. You will need the following:

- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux): Visual Studio Code is an IDE developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.</br>
An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. What makes an IDE so useful is the I: integrated. You could use just about anything for a development environment and many people use a variety of basic, individual programs in place of an IDE but an integrated environment gives you the ability to do everything in a single editor.  
- [python3.7](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04/): You will need to install the latest version of python3.7.* . Why Python? because it's friggin awesome. You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications. Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks.


#### How to run things on the terminal

The terminal is an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands. It can be much faster to complete some tasks using a Terminal than with graphical applications and menus. Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts. A common terminal task of installing an application can be achieved within a single command, compared to navigating through the Software Centre or Synaptic Manager.

- Running python: one cool thing about a terminal is you can run python scripts or scripts of any language.

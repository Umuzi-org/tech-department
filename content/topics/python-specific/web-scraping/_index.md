Python's `beautifulsoup` package is great for web-scraping. See the documentation at [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

An example of using web-scraping for a data project is [I was looking for a house, so I built a web scraper in Python!](https://towardsdatascience.com/looking-for-a-house-build-a-web-scraper-to-help-you-5ab25badc83e).

title: Intro to hybrid mobile
---

You've been coding for some time already so I'm just going to jump stright in.

The ideal that hybrid mobile dev aims for is: Write once, run anywhere. Basically the idea is that you can write your app once and it will run on android and iphone, and maybe even web and desktop too. There was apoint in time when that ideal sounded childish and...well...idealistic. But modern tools let us achieve just that! (under certain circumstances)

Hybrid mobile dev comes in a few differant flavours. The flavour we'll be covering here is Angular + Ionic. So the path you'll follow is a little something like this:

First get comfortable with Typescript. Typescript is a lot like Javascript and Javascript is the most versatile language in the world. So this skill on its own is pretty great.

You'll need to be able to do all the good stuff in this language: flow control, scoping, oop, tdd, you know the deal.

Then you'll need to learn a little bit about the how and why of web design. This flavor of hybrid dev is web based and your app should have a pretty face. This will also serve as a refresher for your HTML and CSS knowledge.

Then we get onto the good stuff: Angular and Ionic! You'll build a bunch of small projects of increasing difficulty. Each project will introduce a new skill.

**Note** a lot of the projects you'll come across in this course are actually a part of our web dev course. It's a nice course but it means that some of the instructions might be a little bit confusing. Here's what you need to know:

- If it has a frontend, do it in angular
- if it has a frontend and you have already been introduced to ionic, do it in ionic (unless the project specifically says not to)

Have fun. Learn hard. And help each other

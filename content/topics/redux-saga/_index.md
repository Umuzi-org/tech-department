So thunks are cool and all, but as soon as you try to do anythin actually complicated with them then you end up with some highly indented very messy scrambley code, commonly referred to as callback-hell.

Saga allows you to write simple code in order to manage very complicated side effects.

As usual, the official docs are highly recommended:

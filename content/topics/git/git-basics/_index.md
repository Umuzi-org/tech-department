## What's git all about?

Git is an industry standard tool used for collaboration within teams. We teach it quite early on in our course because without it you will be fairly useless as a professional. Yes, it's that important. The git book (below) has a better introduction.

## The Git Book

You don't need to know absolutely everything about Git in order to start using it. We keep our git repos on Github so don't worry about the server setup stuff.

The first three chapters will serve you well initially:

## What we expect from you

As you progress through this course you will have to write a lot of code. All your code will be submitted to us for review in the form of a git repo. You will be expected to be comfortable using git from the command line.

## General best practices

- make a separate repo for every project (we don't want to have to sift through unrelated code when marking your work)
- make sure that you _push_ your latest work before leaving the office every day
- if you are working on a team, make sure you _pull_ the master branch often
- give your git branches meaningful and specific names
- give your commits meaningful messages

## Github

We use Github for keeping our code safe. [Here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) is a little intro.

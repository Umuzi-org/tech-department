## JDBC - Java Database Connectivity

JDBC is an API that consists of interfaces used to access relational databases such as SQL.

Note: A relational database is one where the database can recognise relationships/links between the data saved in it.

JDBC allows a Java application to connect to a SQL server and run SQL scripts to work with the databases 
on the server and manipulate the tables and the data stored within them.

- [Example:](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/jdbc-select-records.htm) Connect to a database server and fetch data from the database.


## JPA - Java Persistence API


JPA allows an individual to communicate with a database without having to create SQL queries. It bridges
the gap between SQL and Java. For instance, you can create a modal and by adding certain annotations to it, you
can create/alter the database.

[Here's](https://www.javaworld.com/article/3373652/java-persistence-with-jpa-and-hibernate-part-1-entities-and-relationships.html) a quick tutorial that outlines some of the functionality that JPA provides.

## Hibernate

JPA provides the interface (the set of rules that need to be followed). But alone it does nothing.
It needs to be implemented. This is where Hibernate comes in.

Without JPA though, Hibernate can still be used to communicate with the database in a similar manner, as can be seen
[here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_examples.htm).

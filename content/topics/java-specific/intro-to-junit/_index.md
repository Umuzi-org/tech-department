Unit testing is hella important. Basically if your code doesn't have a solid suite of tests that run and pass then it won't be accepted into a larget codebase. This becomes important if you ever want to work productively on a team. Seriously, the only people who don't have tests on their code are dinosaurs and noobs.

So test your code.

But what does that mean? How do you do it? The first thing you'll need to understand is unit testing.

We'll be usng JUnit to write our unit tests.

Go forth and learn.

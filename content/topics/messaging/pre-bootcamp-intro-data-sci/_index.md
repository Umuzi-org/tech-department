The main technologies used in data science are Python and R. While Python is fairly new compared to R, and not only used in data science, but also in web development. 

R:
- created to handle statistical computing and popular for academic research and professionals in statistics-based industries
- great for data manipulation
- great for publication-quality graphs very easily
- powerful statistical modeling
- not great for beginner programmers
- ease of interaction with Github

Python:
- very easy and intuitive to learn for beginners
- large and diverse community in more disciplines
- increased communication between open-source languages (including Github)
- forces users to learn to write better code
- faster at processing large datasets 
- easier to load files and can handle Big Data

For our Data Science bootcamp, we will use Python and require you to have some Git skills (a life-long skill in the data science and software development industry).

Wish you all the best!

title: Extra bootcamp preparation instructions for web devs
---

Web technologies are increadibly powerful and we want to plug you into the best parts of it.

The three main technologies in web development are:

- HTML: this is used to define the layout of web pages
- CSS: This is used to add some style, eg: you can turn certain parts of your layout green and put borders around other parts
- JavaScript: This is the smarts - this adds cool and clever interativity to your site

We'll be starting with JavaScript. And Git.

Git is a tool that most professional software teams use every day. If you get into Umuzi you'll use it every day (like a professional). And you'll need it for the bootcamp. It's not a web dev thing, Git is a life skill.

A lot of people start with HTML when they learn to do web dev. We are starting with the hard stuff because we want to see how you deal with hard stuff.

Do your best!

Hello and welcome to the next phase of your journey with us. The Bootcamp!

## Tilde

## Attendance

Now you are meant to treat this bootcamp like a full time job. When we used to run our bootcamps at our offices we used to take attendance. Now you need to take your own attendance!

We want to basically know how much time you are spending working and how well you plan out your day and what times of day you like to work.

- [Morning form](https://forms.gle/KUdirFChjKsxuxN6A) Complete this when you start your work day
- [End of day form](https://forms.gle/h5e8sWKexB4au1k66) Complete this when you finish your work day

Generally you'll want to spend at least 8 hours working every day. Some like to work more than that, but 8 is a good number.

**note** when you fill in this form then make sure you use the email address that you use for Tilde login.

## Emails

You'll be recieving a bunch of emails from Github. You'll be invited to collaborate on a bunch of repos. Please accept all the invites.

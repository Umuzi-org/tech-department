A big part of learning to be a programmer of any kind is knowing how to get help. This means knowing how to ask questions.

Your questions should be short and clear. Your question should include all the information that is needed to answer the question.

Stack Overflow is a wonderful resource. Take a look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask. Sign up for stackoverflow and try to use it.

Practice asking good questions. It's like a superpower. If you are easy to help then people will help you.

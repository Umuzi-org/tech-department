Maintaining someone else’s code is not a smooth process. It takes time to observe the project ( such as the folder structure, naming, dependencies, scripts etc.), to find the pattern and develop the new feature in harmony and consistency with the existing code. Different developers use different styles which are derived from their different tastes. They may work on a project together or pick up someone else’s work. Which in both cases, having a common ground is essential.

#### JavaScript Naming Conventions

There is an introduction about [ JavaScript Naming Conventions here]( https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-naming-conventions ) with examples, which gives you the common sense when it comes to naming variables, functions, classes or components in JavaScript. No one is enforcing these naming convention rules, however, they are widely accepted as a standard in the JS community.

#### Use ESLint

[ ESLint] ( http://eslint.org/ ) is a quality tool that inspects code and warns a developer about potential problems. It is available online and can also be integrated into several development environments, so errors will be highlighted when writing code. It also has rules that relate to better ways of doing things to help you avoid problems.

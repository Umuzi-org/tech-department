Naming conventions and other good Java practices are listed in the [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html).

Also see these naming conventions. Although the information on this [document](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-135099.html) has not been updated in ages, the content is still relevant to the conventions that are still used today.

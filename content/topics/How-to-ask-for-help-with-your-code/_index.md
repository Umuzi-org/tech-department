A big part of learning to be a programmer of any kind is knowing how to get help. This means knowing how to ask questions.
Your questions should be short and clear. Your question should include all the information that is needed to answer the question.
Practice asking good questions. It's like a superpower. If you are easy to help then people will help you.<br/><br/>

### These also include:

#### how to ask good questions on slack:

* all Slack questions should be addressed on the slack **Tech Assist** channel.
 - This helps you get to a broad audience from the tech department (.e.g Recruits, Managers and Alumni).
 - Please don't send screenshots what you can do is use backtick (` `) characters to represent a code form.
 - Write full error messages. (Summarise if you can and make sure you understand the error before sending it)
 - If your issues are not addressed on the "Tech Assist" Channel, then run your issue with your specific department channel, then if it doesn't help then run to your **cohort mentors**.
 **NB. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP OTHERS WHEN AND IF YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS** (Basically help and be helped)  

#### Things to note

- Stack Overflow is a wonderful resource. Take a look at [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and sign up for it and try to use it.
- A similar good way to use [Google](https://www.google.com) is when searching for something specific, try using quotes to minimize the guesswork for Google search. When you put your search parameters in quotes, it tells the search engine to search for the whole phrase.

title: Why should data scientiss learn Django?
---

Junior data scientists complete the programme mostly focussing on tools and techniques for experimentation such as Jupyter notebooks, Google Datastudio, Dash and Plotly. They create dashboards mostly using Dash and Plotly to generate insights for use in designing better experiments in the data science projects. They have an in-depth understanding of machine learning principles, but lack an in-depth understanding of building dashboards and machine learning web applications for integration into software products. Django being a popular ubiquitous Python Web framework, it is an efficient way for data scientists to master techniques on building scalable, end-to-end data-driven solutions for dashboards, predictions and recommendations solutions for business insights.

Please go through the following tutorial.

Remember that when using Django you should be using modern Python. If you are using Pythhon2.7 that would be a problem.

To check your python version:

```
python --version
```

You should be using some version of Python 3. At time of writing Python3.8 is available.

You should also be using a virtual environment or similar to isolate your django application and its depedencies.

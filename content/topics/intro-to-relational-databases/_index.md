# INTRODUCTION TO RELATIONAL DATABASE 

**LESSONS**

- Lesson 1: 
  > Data and Tables:
    * learn the principles behind relational data organization:tables,queries,aggregations,
    keys and joins.
- Lesson2:
    > Elements of **SQL**
    * start learning  by using **select** & **insert** statements/commands to read and write
     data to database tables
- Lesson3: 
  > Nodejs SQL-API: 
    * learn SQL-APIs and  apply your knowledge to fix common bugs that arise from database-backend-web service

- Lesson4:
  > Deeper Into SQL 
## What a Relational Database Is:
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that
are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive,
straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table
is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data,
and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships
among data points.

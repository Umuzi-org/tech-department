**Best practices**  
```
*(N.B)* 
If your using VIM or VI as your code Editor...

Always do not forget to include your .gitignore file
which will have contain you files you want to exclude 
when git pushing into remote repository and commit the 
changes, before you add your the changed files Otherwise,
you run the risk of committing and pushing swap files 
which are not required in Git.
```

```//.gitignore examples:
FOR PYTHON & FOR Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files:
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

FOR VIM:
*.swp
*.swo
```

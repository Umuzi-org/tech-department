### Beginning Android Development

There aren't any prerequisites for this tutorial, other than a willing mind and a Mac or PC. You can develop for Android on both a Mac or a PC. The instructions are similar but slightly different between macOS, Windows and Linux.

You will need to ensure the following installed on your system:

- Install the latest version of Android Studio. Versions higher than 2.0 comes with built in support for Kotlin. Older versions require installation of a Kotlin plugin.
- Install Java JDK 8.0 or higher. Older versions may work. It's Logical to install the latest then go down from there, if you encounter any incompatibility issues. Do not go lower than 8 as support for Lambda in version 8.0 upwards.
- Make sure you have the latest or stable version of Android SDK installed.

Please feel free to google a setup process for your specific OS or use the links below. Setup may vary according to the time of content creation. Please use your google ability to solve any setup issues you may encounter.

Ask your senior for help if all else fails.

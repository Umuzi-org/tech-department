- [Statically](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/22321/statically-typed)[typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) language.
- Developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
- Java is a prerequisite for Kotlin.
- Can be used for: server-[side](https://careerkarma.com/blog/client-vs-server-side-development/), client side and android development.
- [Interoperable](https://dev.to/jay_tillu/how-kotlin-provides-100-interoperability-with-java-4c16).
- [Concise](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html) syntax over java.

**Interesting features of Kotlin:**

- Open [Source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25149/open-source-language).
- [Interoperability](https://www.codementor.io/@packt/interoperability-between-java-and-kotlin-rifmhfip0).
- [Concise](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html) up to 40% less line of code than java.
- Easy to learn. [Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) is similar to java.
- [Feature](https://dzone.com/articles/5-kotlin-features-that-every-android-app-developer) rich.

**Hello World example you should try.**

This will help you understand the basics of the Kotlin programming language.


```
 fun Main(args : Array<String>) {      

printlin(“Hello World”)   //Similar to System.out.println(“Hello World”) in Java. 

} 
```



Output

Hello World!

Breakdown:

fun Main(args : Array\&lt;String\&gt;){}

  - &#39;fun&#39;, is the keyword in Kotlin for function.
  - This is the main function, just as in java it serves as the entry point to the application.
  - Mandatory function of the Kotlin program.
  - Code should be written in curly brackets.
  - Text that should be printed on the screen should be in double quotes &quot;&quot;.

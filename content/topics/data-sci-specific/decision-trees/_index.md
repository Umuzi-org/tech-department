## Background material
- Walk through the [machine learning Kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
- Complete the DataCamp tutorial on [Tree-Based Models](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python)

## Assignment
Use a decision tree model to predict customer churn (the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame).

1. Split your data into train and test sets.
2. Get basic descriptive statistics for the training data and check for missing and incorrect or extreme values. Get scatterplots or heatmaps showing the relationship between the variables.
3. What are the factors that predict user churn?
4. Report the accuracy of your model on the training set and on the test set. How successful is the model - what is its sensitivity and specificity?
5. What is the churn prevalence? How might prevalence affect the positive and negative predictive values of a test/model?

Find the data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

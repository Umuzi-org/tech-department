# IPIP Big-Five Factor Markers

 A measure of the big five personality traits; namely, extraversion, neuroticism,
 agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience.
 This test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool,
 developed by Goldberg (1992).

The test consists of fifty items rated agree, neutral or disagree. To keep scoring consistent with the
original five point scale, items are scored 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral and 5=Agree.

It takes most people 3-8 minutes to complete.

## Questionnaire scoring
Scores are saved as tuples. The first values of the tuple indicates the subscale to which the item belongs: (1) Extraversion, (2) Agreeableness, (3) Conscientiousness, (4) Emotional Stability/Neuroticism, or (5) Intellect/Imagination / openness to experiences). The second value indicates the individual's answers.

Once numbers are assigned for all of the items in the scale,  sum all the values within a subscale (e.g. extraversion) to obtain a total subscale score.

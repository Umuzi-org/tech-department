# Tutorials

- [Create a Plotly Dashboard in under 10 minutes](https://moderndata.plot.ly/create-a-plotly-dashboards-in-under-10-minutes/) (Easy)
- [Create a dashboard with Pusher and Flask](https://pusher.com/tutorials/live-dashboard-python) (Advanced)

# Instructions

Watch the sessions on [Dashboarding with Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/dashboarding-with-notebooks-day-1/notebook). Use one of the updating data sources referred to in the Kaggle sessions to create a dashboard with Jupyter Notebooks and Plotly (or, if you are feeling up to the task, Flask).

**BONUS POINTS:** Use [beautifulsoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to scrape live data off a website. Make a dashboard from this data.

title: Scheduling workshops and events
---

This is specifically for workshops that are compulsory for specific cohorts and optional for others. Eg: This is allowed "Introduction to Unit testing with Jasmine, Compulsory C14B, All welcome".

Process for staff members:

1. Create the event on your personal umuzi calander. Say who should be there. Include a useful description as much as possible, even links to materials if appropriate
2. Invite the "Umuzi tech events FOR RECRUITS" calander
   - if your event doesn't clash with anything on the tech events calander it will automatically be accepted
   - if it DOES clash then it will automatically be rejected

This automation is set up on purpose. For the most part we should never make a recruit from any cohort unwelcome in any internal workshop or event. So they should not clash.

## Updating events

Workshops can be rescheduled at least a day in advance. If a workshop is happening TODAY then the time should be considered immutable. Because we don't mess our recruits around. And because we want to demonstrate good time managment and planning skills so that the recruits can learn good habits from us.

To reschedule an event simply update the event in your own calander (if you set the event up in the first place)

### Clashes

Be mindful of how events get automatically rejected if they clash. If you put an event on this calander then it should make sense in that context.

## Scheduling External workshops and events (eg: meetups)

- Post a link to the event in the slack channel #meetups-and-events
- Put the event on the "Umuzi tech events FOR RECRUITS" calendar
- Attach a form where recruits can sign up to attend (so that transport can be organised etc) (TODO)
- tell te recruits about when they need to fill in the form by, what's the maximum number of people who can go etc

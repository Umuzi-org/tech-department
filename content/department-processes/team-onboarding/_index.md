This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful.

### General

#### Ground Rules
- Arrive before 9:00 and ensure you are up to date on recruit activities and any announcements you may have for stand-up
- Don't be late for workshops - if you commit to doing a workshop ensure it happens and start on time.
- Deep work days - Staff that need to are allowed to take work from home 1 day per week - The team needs to be notified in advance via slack with at least one day prior notice.
- Your responsibilities are yours to handle - should you be unable to deal with one of them arrange someone to cover for you and ensure that it gets done.

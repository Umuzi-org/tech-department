This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful.

## Ground Rules

In order to be efficient and productive we have some ground rules:
You are expected to be at your desk most of the time between _9am and 5pm (barring lunch)_

- Don't be late for workshops.
- Don't be late for standup.
- Don't be disruptive and noisy in the work area, this is a place for focus.
- Submit your projects on time via the link in the repo.
- Submit high quality work and do your best.

## Daily Tech Events

These happen everyday and are compulsory for everyone to attend.

##### Stand up

This is how we begin our day, announcements are shared and we discuss anything that hinders progress.

- Every morning at 09:00

##### After Lunch Event

_handled by Tech Facilitators_

This is a daily compulsary after lunch event. There are a variety of events we will be doing with you in orer to improve your coding, interpersonal and presentation skills . There is a [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ue5vfIjtCpqgIEp_Va9kurBm9khQ4oVE4Nf4DgSFpq4/edit#gid=0) that specifies who will present on which day.

- Everyday after lunch at 13:30

##### Tech Meetups

_Handled by Singi_

At least once a month (usually more) we attend a meetup. We get to learn on what's new in the tech world, learn more on the technology and languages we already know. Meetups are free, no cost to you.

Here's a link to the [Meetup Form for RSVPing](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcIE6NU44zfybMsd_HhAU8eFM7LgIUQ5WXcJfe3KaPQgru4Q/viewform)
Use the form to RSVP for transport (which we provide).

## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:

##### Slack

This is the most important platform for communication. There are various slack channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

Make sure you check your slack at least 3 times a day.

_Why is slack important?_

- Slack (and tools like slack) are industry standards. So start developing good habits now
- Our staff are not always in the office, sometimes work happens off site. But communication should still happen

##### Emails

For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.
Check your emails at least once a day.

##### WhatsApp groups

For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### NCIT Material & Assessments

As you will be doing assessments for your National Certificate in Information Technology - Systems Development
The material and assessments are found on [Gnomio](http://umuzi.gnomio.com/). This is where you will also submit these assessments

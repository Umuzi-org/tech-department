This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful.

## Ground Rules

In order to be efficient and productive we have some ground rules:
You are expected to be at your desk most of the time between _9am and 5pm (barring lunch)_

- Don't be late for workshops.
- Don't be late for standup.
- Don't be disruptive and noisy in the work area, this is a place for focus.

## Daily Tech Events

These happen everyday and are compulsory for everyone to attend.

##### Stand up

This is how we begin our day, announcements are shared and we discuss anything that hinders progress.

- Every morning at 09:00

##### Lunchtime presentation

_handled by Kii_
This is where we exercise our presentation muscle, one recruit prepares a 5 minute presentation about something tech related - what you’ve learnt, something you’re working on or any resources that you think might be useful. There is a [Schedule][ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zovv2tfk14iwyapa-htabexrja3gymp9sm4wpglr0qs/edit?usp=sharing] that specifies who will present on which day.

- Everyday after lunch at 13:30,

##### The Productivity Award

_Handled by Kii_
To encourage productivity, recruits are allocated points on a specific Criteria which comprises:

- Attendance
- Project Submission
- Posting relevant material on Slack
- Asking and/or providing solutions to a problem posted on Slack
- Presentations
- Reviewing someone else’s code
- Doing useful pull requests
- Having your code merged.

Here's a link to the [Calendar][https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=dw11emkub3jnxzf1dgs1owjuc2rqmdnpzdi3zzlzzgjmb2ewqgdyb3vwlmnhbgvuzgfylmdvb2dszs5jb20]that all tech events are scheduled on. This is where yu will find dates for Workshops, Talks and Meetups. Check this everyday.

##### Tech Meetups

_Handled by Singi_

At least once a month (usually more) we attend a meetup. We get to learn on what's new in the tech world, learn more on the technology and languages we already know. Meetups are free, no cost to you.

Here's a link to the [Meetup Form for RSVPing][https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsdcie6nu44zfybmsd_hhau8efm7lgiuq5wxcjfe3kapqgru4q/viewform]
Use the form to RSVP for transport (which we provide).

## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:

##### Slack

This is the most important platform for communication. There are various slack channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

Make sure you check your slack at least 3 times a day.

_Why is slack important?_

- Slack (and tools like slack) are industry standards. So start developing good habits now
- our staff are not always in the office, sometimes work happens off site. But communication should still happen

##### Emails

For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.
Check your emails at least once a day.

##### WhatsApp groups

For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### NCIT Material & Assessments

As you will be doing assessments for your National Certificate in Information Technology - Systems Development
The material and assessments are found on [Gnomio](http://umuzi.gnomio.com/). This is where you will also submit these assessments

### Important Spreadsheets, Forms and Calendars (I suggest you bookmark these)

- [Coding & Data Programme Outline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ssirw8sit3-ivzpntiniciwd4mg1cdoxbv14ypsmpw/edit?usp=sharing)
  This spreadsheet is the source of truth, make sure to check it regularly. The tech staff updates the spreadsheet once per week, usually on Monday afternoon.

- [Code Project Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlsfzgqrys-duv3csotatrv77u1rylyb9l4upkecktde2nybpyq/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  This form is to submit your code projects which makes it easier for the facilitators and Senior managers to review your work.

- [Deadline Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=dw11emkub3jnxzdtn3zwoxq1m2vubgk3ytvuodntowdpownvqgdyb3vwlmnhbgvuzgfylmdvb2dszs5jb20)
  This is where every date for submission is posted. It corresponds with the dates that are in the Program Outline.

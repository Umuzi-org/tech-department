**NOTE: While we are in remote-work mode things will be a little bit different. Any reference to being at your desk and what not might not apply.**

This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful.

## Umuzi Handbook

This documentation has EVERYTHING you need to know about Umuzi. The recruit user journey, the processes and protocols and the culture of Umuzi are all found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aal5u4dUAU1WvAWEWeW4uYVu8c4Q2JbwZuFcJqG2kbQ/edit#heading=h.qudvz63naw4s)

## Ground Rules

In order to be efficient and productive we have some ground rules:
You are expected to be online most of the time between _9am and 5pm (barring lunch)_

- Don't be late for workshops.
- Don't be late for standup.
- Don't be disruptive and noisy during workshops and meetings.
- Submit your projects on time via Tilde. And follow
- Submit high quality work and do your best.
- Communicate problems to the staff (you are not in this alone but we cannot help you if you don't communicate)
- Always complete your attendance check here for details: {{% contentlink "remote-work"  %}}

## Tilde

Tilde means home and during your time at Umuzi this will be the home of the majority or your learnings as well as the board that shows you your user journey and what you will be working on next. 

You can access Tilde [Here](https://tilde-front-dot-umuzi-prod.nw.r.appspot.com/)

## Daily Tech Events

These happen everyday and are compulsory for everyone to attend.

##### Stand up

This is how we begin our day, announcements are shared and we discuss anything that hinders progress.

- Every morning at 09:00

##### Tech Meetups

These are currently carried out online due to COVID-19 keep an eye on the `#meetups-and-events` channel on Rocket Chat

## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:

##### Rocket Chat

This is the most important platform for communication. There are various Rocket Chat channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

Make sure you check your Rocket Chat at least 3 times a day.

_Why is Rocket Chat important?_

- Rocket Chat (and tools like Rocket Chat) are industry standards. So start developing good habits now
- Our staff are not always in the office, sometimes work happens off site. But communication should still happen

##### Emails

For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.
Check your emails at least once a day.

##### WhatsApp groups

For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### NCIT Material & Assessments

As you will be doing assessments for your National Certificate in Information Technology - Systems Development
The material and assessments are found on [Gnomio](http://umuzi.gnomio.com/). This is where you will also submit these assessments

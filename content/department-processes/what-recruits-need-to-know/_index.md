## Ground Rules

In order to be efficient and productive we have some ground rules:
You are expected to be online most of the time between _9am and 5pm (barring lunch)_

There are a few things that can go wrong:

1. Loadshedding: In the case of loadshedding we still expect you to fill in the form as early as possible
2. Personal illness or emergency. You can apply for leave using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRy444hA3WR4Vul4nTXOuC0x9ZuA3TFBaB8aA-PPMDCeQN8g/viewform). And if something crazy comes up just communicate with your cohort leader via Rocketchat.

### Good professional behaviour

When people arrive at Umuzi they aren't professionals yet. But when they leave they are.

Here are a few professional behaviors you should start practicing today:

- **Communicate Communicate Communicate** communication is key to success. 
 - If you were or will be late or absent **communicate**
 - If you have a problem **communicate**
 - If you are unsure of something **communicate**
- Check your calendars daily. This includes the calendars mentioned below.
- Check your Rocket Chat at lease 3 times daily (Morning, Midday, and before you log off).
- Check your email at lease 3 times daily (Morning, Midday, and before you log off).
- Always be on time for workshops and meetings
- Always be respectful and helpful to your peers
- Ask the dumb questions! Some people are too shy to ask so ask for them
- Push to github daily.
- Always submit high quality work
- Always submit your work on time
- DO NOT copy or plagiarize your work.
- Strive for understanding
- When you get feedback about your work, implement it

##### Tech Meetups

These are currently carried out online due to COVID-19 keep an eye on the `#meetups-and-events` channel on Rocket Chat

## How we work remotely

[Here](https://umuzi-org.github.io/tech-department/remote-work/) you can see how we work remotely and our current conventions and practices, we also make changes to our procedures as and when needed but try to keep this up to date as we evolve.

## Communication

Communication is a crucial part of the department and also encourages productivity.
We use:

##### Rocket Chat

This is the most important platform for communication. There are various Rocket Chat channels for different purposes. The sole purpose is to administer communication between recruits and the tech staff:

- To get feedback from managers.
- To share relevant material and opportunities with fellow recruits.
- To get departmental and cohort specific announcements.

Make sure you check your Rocket Chat at least 3 times a day.

_Why is Rocket Chat important?_

- Rocket Chat (and tools like Rocket Chat) are industry standards. So start developing good habits now
- Our staff are not always in the office, sometimes work happens off site. But communication should still happen

##### Emails

For any official communication and setting up meetings, events and workshops.
Check your emails at least once a day.

##### WhatsApp groups

For communication within cohorts and the mighty Coding Department WhatsApp group for the whole department.

##### NCIT Material & Assessments

As you will be doing assessments for your National Certificate in Information Technology - Systems Development
The material and assessments are found on [Gnomio](http://umuzi.gnomio.com/). This is where you will also submit these assessments

title: code review process
---

If a recruit submits a code assignment then we kick off a multi-phase review process.

## Phase 1: junior review

If code is submitted by a recruit then that code should be reviewed by a junior reviewer by the end of the next working day. If the workload is too big for junior staff then they need to seek out assistace as early as possible so that we can hit this target.

Assistance can come in the form of senior help, or help from specific trusted recruits.

- junior facilitators will fill in this form as they review code: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1_aouHSds1Vx-FkWcq5gKyTxwzRylJMa_7ZDkA99M2aVbZg/viewform?usp=sf_link
- If the code under review is not up to our standards but the junior reviewer believes they can help the recruit improve then:
  - this should be marked on the form (in the "Next Steps" section)
  - the facilitator should spend time with the recruit to help them to understand what needs to be fixed. This should be done by the end of the next day
  - the facilitator should review the code AGAIN. and fill in the form AGAIN to show what has been resolved

Junior reviewers should slack the senior reviewers when this is all complete

### Phase 2: senior review process

Senior review WORKSHOP must happen within 3 working days of the junior review being complete.

Once the junior review process has been completed then the senior review process begins

- if any recruit has been marked as a RED FLAG during the junior review process then this should be dealt with on a case by case basis. This mighe mean giving extra help and support to the recruit in question, or it might mean taking disciplinery action
- the senior reviewer will go through all the code that the junior reviewer is happy with and take notes on:
  - what is awesome
  - what can be done better
  - just look for teachable things

The senior reviewer will schedule a group review workshop. This workshop MUST BE attended by junior reviewers. It should not be open to other cohorts because we dont want to tear anyone's code to pieces in front of a large audience. If any bad code needs to be highlighted then dont mentioon any names, keep it gentle, don't point fingers at anyone unless it is to highlight something good.

## Pase 0: peer review

Recruits should review each other's code as well. When a recruit is new to our program then they wont know what good code looks like. But once they have had their code reviewed a few times then they can be useful in reducing our code review work load. This process still nees to be flashed out.

Options here are:

- get senior recruits to help junior recruits. Eg: C12s can review C13s. The benefit to this is: we will stimulate knowledge sharing between cohorts, and we can potentially implement this from day 1
- get recruits to review their peers (C12s review other C12s)

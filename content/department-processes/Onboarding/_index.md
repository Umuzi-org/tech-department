This is a guide to the Tech Department and how it works. It contains contact details, important links to documents we use and software that are useful.

### General

#### Syllabus
Find the tech repo with all (or at least most) curriculum documents, assignments, processes and deadlines here: https://umuzi-org.github.io/tech-department/

#### Slack 
All management discussion for the tech department is on tech-team, other channels are for communication with recruits. In particular, you want to be on tech-assist (helping with tech problems), meetups-and-events (info about meetups etc that are happening), umuzi_coders (all coders) and umuzi_data (all data scientists), plus relevant cohort channels (e.g. c14-data, c13_data). Please check your slack messages regularly throughout the day (at least 3 times per day).

In order to make sure our department is as effective, efficient and scalable as possible we need a few ground rules. The documents contained in this section aim to help us do our jobs better. If anything in here gets in the way of progress, if anything starts to smell like useless bureaucracy, then it should be revised or removed.

These are living documents. They are up for debate, and will be added to over time.

## A few things to think about

- what can we do better?
- what should we stop doing?
- what do we value that is not expressed in our priorities and processes?
- what in this document should change?
- how can we stimulate better knowledge sharing between cohorts?
- how can we stimulate better accountability?

- how about live-coding workshops. Having senior team members run those can be very useful, empowering and encouraging junior team members to do them would be very powerful
- how can we best use and educate our strategist recruits who are helping our tech department as a "product"?

- How can we scale better? Umuzi will grow

  - what will the tech department look like if we triple in size? How can we remain effective and keep our signal to noise ratio good?
  - how will we onboard new team members so that they can be effective from day 1?
  - what if we open another Umuzi studio? How do we ensure that the lessons we learn here can be copy-pasted into a new environment? And how will we make sure that lessons learned by staff in those new environments are available to everyone on the team?

- how can we do nitty gritty annoying tasks (eg: attendance) better?

A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called #MakeUmuziBetter. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi--anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.
Months 1-5: Systems Development and Data Science
The first few months for a Umuzi tech recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5), while also learning basic data science concepts. 

A note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation:
Umuzi is a registered training provider with MICT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognise their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements. Below we refer to the formal NCIT requirements e.g. NCIT01: Business and technology.

Write a function that takes in number as argument and draws a pyramid triangle above using the " * " characters . If the input is 4, then the output is a traingle shaped as pyramid with height 4.

**Input**:

```js
let triangle=(n)=>{
        //clever things
} 
```

```py
def triangle(5):
```
**Output**
```
expected output: PYRAMID TRIANGLE.

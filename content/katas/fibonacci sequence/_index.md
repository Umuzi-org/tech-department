 **What is fibonacci sequence?**

> Fibonacci Sequence: is the series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the n numbers before it.
> e.g. in this case n = 2:
> sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

**1.** 
write a function that takes in a number argument [n] and returns fibonacci sequence of the given number [n], "series of values" 

```js
//javascript
function fibonacci(144)

Expected output:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
```

```py
#py
def fibonacci(34):

Expected output:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

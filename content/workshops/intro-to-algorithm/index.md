title: Suggested plan to get the C17 group up to speed with algorithm

ready: true
---

The C17 are struggling with getting up an running with coding.
Sheena has asked me to help them get started.

## The plan

### What

The following Algorithm concept will be introduced during the workshop:

1. Naming convention (camel case)
2. Printing output
3. Pseudocode basics
4. Sequence (simple example of making a cup of tea)
5. Selection (If, then, else)
6. Iteration (while…do)
7. Practice
   1. Number comparison: check if a number is a prime number then display a certain output
   2. Count until one reach a certain number
   3. Display the total of a certain type of number

### How

This is a hand-on activity.
Recruit will firstly be invited to think and work away from computer then progressively implement their algorithm on the computer as they grasp each concept.
Recruit will be introduce to the concept of algorithm including Algorithm thinking and design.

### When

- Session 1 : Friday 15th of November (Introduction to Algorithm concepts)
- Session 2 : Monday18th of November (Algorithm practice - in group)
- Session 3 : Tuesday 19th of November ( Algorithm practice - individual)
- Future sessions TBA (Code wars and Hackarank)

## Implementation

Please download content to be used during the workshop [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V9fvY8fyTDSbnYpl7n_tD0-JKz5ikqEu).

### Day 1.

1. Naming convention (camel case)

There are many ways to name variable but it is recommended to Introduce participant to a single naming convention to avoid confusion.
camel case will will be used throughout the workshop

2. Sequence (simple example of making a cup of tea)

Introduce participant to the sequence used by computer to run a program (top-bottom). This should guide them into how to go about writing their program (see slide 13-14).

Use making a cup of tea sequence as example.
Turn the example into pseudocode (see slide 16-17)

3.  Selection (If, then, else)

Selection or choice making. This should allow them understand how choices are made and understand different type that exist (see slide from 18-25).
use making tea example and different alternative according to choices.

Use the following example :

- Read in a number, check if it is odd or even.

Group work

- Read in two numbers, call them A and B. Is A is bigger than B, print out A, otherwise print out B.
  - Read in three numbers, call them A, B and C.
  - If A is bigger than B, then if A is bigger than C, print out  A, otherwise print out C.
  - If B is bigger than A, then if B is bigger than C, print out B, otherwise print out C.

4. Iteration (while…do)

Doing something until some condition occur (see slide 26-30)

Use the following example

Group work

- Print out the numbers from 1 to 5
  Add up the numbers 1 to 5 and print out the result
  Read in a number and check if it’s a prime number.

Share the benefit of using iteration (see slide 33-41)

### Day 2

Candidate to pair up and pick one challenge

- Read in a number, check if it is odd or even.
- Read in two numbers, call them A and B. Is A is bigger than B, print out A, otherwise print out B.
- Read in three numbers, call them A, B and C.
  - If A is bigger than B, then if A is bigger than C, print out  A, otherwise print out C.
  - If B is bigger than A, then if B is bigger than C, print out B, otherwise print out C
- Print out the numbers from 1 to 5
  _ Add up the numbers 1 to 5 and print out the result
  _ Read in a number and check if it’s a prime number.

title: Suggested plan to get the C17 group up to speed with algorithm

ready: true
---

The C17 are struggling with getting up an running with coding.
Sheena has asked me to help them get started.

## The plan

### What

The following Algorithm concept will be introduced during the workshop:

1. Naming convention (camel case)
2. Printing output
3. Pseudocode basics
4. Sequence (simple example of making a cup of tea)
5. Selection (If, then, else)
6. Iteration (whileâ€¦do)
7. Practice
   1. Number comparison: check if a number is a prime number then display a certain output
   2. Count until one reach a certain number
   3. Display the total of a certain type of number

### How

This is a hand-on activity.
Recruit will firstly be invited to think and work away from computer then progressively implement their algorithm on the computer as they grasp each concept.
Recruit will be introduce to the concept of algorithm including Algorithm thinking and design.

### When

- Session 1 : Friday 15th of November (Introduction to Algorithm concepts)
- Session 2 : Monday18th of November (Algorithm practice - in group)
- Session 3 : Tuesday 19th of November ( Algorithm practice - individual)
- Future sessions TBA (Code wars and Hackarank)

Month -1: Online Learning and Bootcamp
During the application process, we ask prospective recruits to learn basic python with an introduction to data management and visualisation with pandas, numpy and matplotlib. In the screening process, they also complete aptitude (literacy, numeracy, logical thinking, problem solving, statistical understanding, and sequencing) and personality tests (grit, resilience, empathising and systemising, agreeableness, openness to new experience, emotional stability, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination). Those who perform well on the aptitude tests, are a good personality fit for work professionalism, and are able to learn new skills on their own, are invited for an interview, and a selection of interviewees are invited bootcamp.

During bootcamp, the final stage of of Umuzi’s selection process, the applicants continue with online learning, presenting the results of their work at the end of the bootcamp. In addition to these technical challenges, we also have a series of teamwork challenges to learn how they communicate within a team and work under pressure; as well as individual tasks to assess ability to follow instructions, control impulsive reactions and plan actions. If the applicant performs well during bootcamp, they are invited to join Umuzi as a recruit.

Month 0: #MakeUmuziBetter
A recruit’s journey starts with a three-week programme called #MakeUmuziBetter. Recruits from all departments form small cross-functional teams to tackle issues at Umuzi--anything from mental health to kitchen norms to the physical layout of our space. To accomplish this, they learn about and execute Human-Centered Design, a technique used throughout their time at Umuzi. Each team maps out user journeys, conducts interviews and surveys, designs a prototype of their solution, and presents it to the staff and external guests.
Months 1-5: Systems Development and Data Science
The first few months for a Umuzi tech recruit are dedicated to obtaining a National Certificate of Information Technology: Systems Development (Level 5), while also learning basic data science concepts. 

A note on Umuzi’s formal qualification and accreditation:
Umuzi is a registered training provider with MICT SETA. Our National Certificate IT (Systems Development) (NCIT) qualification is a learnership requirement (i.e. Umuzi’s employer partners can therefore recognise their training and stipend spend as part of their skills development budgets). We work hard to both meet the National Certificate requirements and deliver a practical and relevant learning experience (which are not always well aligned) however, we firmly believe the most important part is the practical application of learning rather than merely meeting the unit standard requirements. Below we refer to the formal NCIT requirements e.g. NCIT01: Business and technology.

Months 6-9: Product Teams
Product teams are teams of no more than 6 recruits guided by a product owner (Umuzi staff). The teams use the Scrum methodology to build real-world, web-based products. Recruits learn additional frameworks (e.g., Django) and packages as needed for the products.

An example of a current product is Umuzi’s online application process. In the past, Umuzi has used a combination of Google Forms and other, off-the-shelf, tools, to create an online application process for applicants. Now, under the leadership of Umuzi’s Data Science and Web Development managers, a team of Umuzi recruits is developing a custom solution which will allow applicants to apply to Umuzi, complete a variety of online learning and tests, enable managers to easily sort candidates by results, and automatically handle communications with the candidates. It’s through real builds like this that recruits put their learning into practice.
Additional learning
In addition to the curriculum listed above, the recruits participate in workshops given by industry professionals and Umuzi staff. Generally there are 2-3 workshops each month. Topics include time management, public speaking, networking, preparing for technical interviews, introduction to new frameworks, tech trends, etc.

Recruits are also encouraged to attend industry meetups, conferences, and hackathons. On average, recruits attend 1 meetup/conference per month and 1-2 hackathons during their time at Umuzi.

We support a few different learning paths. Data Science, Data Engineering and Web Dev (for now). what follows below is a week-by-week breakdown of these courses. This is all on one page because our various courses have enough in common that it makes sense to keep then syncronised.

## Note

This is a living document and there are a few things that need to be fleshed out:

- as far as possible each bullet point that describes a piece of our syllabus should be marked as a WORKSHOP, TOPIC or PROJECT. Or excercise??
  - WORKSHOP == instructor led event.
  - TOPIC == self study material
  - PROJECT == you know
  - EXCERCISE == like a project but no deliverable. Something the recruits should do to
- every topic, workshop and challenge needs to be linked to
- we need to make sure all the NCIT requirements have been dealt with before hitting the summative assessment
- this doesn't account for MUB so well. MUB should happen sometime...
- the syllabus is really long. There is a lot to cover so that has effects on Product teams. There are decisions to be made there.

## Potential MUB assessments

We might be able to get some of out NCIT assessments out of the way during MUB.

- NCIT 03: Conducting research and user interviews
- NCIT 04: reporting
- NCIT 05: Research presentation
- NCIT 14: Pseudocode and documentation (might be pushing it a bit here)

Here's the plan, the technologies and the processes you need to be aware of:

## Attendance

As you know, SETA is really serious about attendance. But we can't do this the usual way.

We are going to put the power into your hands, you need to take your own attendance! Here are some google forms:

- (Morning form)[https://forms.gle/E2W9cC5cpHQdu1EL7] To be completed by 8:30 every day
- (Afternoon form)[https://forms.gle/68E7WMeWtMz4ryQSA] To be completed between 12:00 and 13:00 every day
- (End of day form)[https://forms.gle/cmUR2DiTgZRisDad8] To be completed from 16:30 onwards

You need to fill these in every single working day or you will be marked absent!

There are a few things that can go wrong:

1. Loadshedding: In the case of loadshedding we still expect you to fill in the form as early as possible
2. Personal illness or emergency. You can apply for leave using (this form)[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRy444hA3WR4Vul4nTXOuC0x9ZuA3TFBaB8aA-PPMDCeQN8g/viewform]. And if something crazy comes up just communicate with your cohort leader via Rocketchat.

## Workshops

We run a bunch of workshops for a bunch of reasons. Sometimes the workshops are about demonstrating some code things, sometimes they are about you demonstrating your understanding of concepts.

Your cohort leader will tell you which workshops are compulsory. You will be expected to join from your computer, not from your phone. You might be asked to share your computer screen.

We will try to record all our workshops and share them on Youtube so if you miss out (maybe there are internet issues or the dreaded loadshedding) you should be able to go and watch things later. Or even refer back to the workshop videos when you need them. Feel free to use the comments section on Youtube to discuss the content.

## Deadlines and projects

We will be giving you assignments to work through. If we give you a deadline and you finish early then that's great! You can either get started with the next syllabus item, work on a product team, or just learn and build cool stuff. We don't want to slow anyone down!

## Project teams and presentations

We've found that people work better when they are supporting each other. Whenever you are given an assignment you will also be given a team. Maybe you'll keep the same team, maybe not.

Here's the procedure:
When you are given as assignment you will be put into a group. The day BEFORE your assignment is due your group will need to present your assignment.

The presentation will go like this. There will be a video call including your whole team and at least one facilitator. The facilitator will pick one person from the team to do all the talking. That person's code will be on display and that person wil need to be explain their work well - it has to be obvious that they know what's up.

The facilitator will give some feedback and possibly look at some of the code from the other team members. Any feedback given in this session needs to be implemented by the handin date (the next day).

Please help each other to understand. The best tech professionals know how to work in a team.

## Getting help

You'll notice that those forms we ask you to fill in are supposed to show us who needs help and who doesn't. There sure are a lot of you so we'll try our best to keep track of what everyone needs. But we are all only human. If you feel like you are not being noticed please feel free to contact:

- your cohort
- your mentor
- your team mates
- your cohort leadership
- managment

Seriously, we're all dedicated to helping you grow as much as possible. Help us to do that by asking for help when you need it.

Here's the plan, the technologies and the processes you need to be aware of:

## Roles

### Junior Tech Lead

Each group is allocated a JTL. The JTL can be either a student or a junior staff member.

**The JTL is a servant leader**

A JTL is not the group boss. They are there to help the team pursue success by helping to give the students what they need. 

What they need !== what they want
### Junior Scrum Master

The junior scrum master is another servant leader position. 

They facilitate scrum events when needed and coach the JTL and the group as a whole on Agile and Scrum best practices.

### Allocations

You can find the JTL and Scrum master allocations [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQgx3k8seHjxNUYSCAnEUwzHw7xtv6o41RpOsJZXMkMjUs-AffVkX7tMZPXLSKd_dUinl3Ccg6Bu00f/pubhtml?gid=289931684&single=true)
## Meetings

### Sprint planning aka board review

**Who**: this is run and owned by a junior scrum master. JTL is present as a source of technical information. JTLâ€™s also help keep it real. Eg if a student says they will do something in a week but it should take a day then the JTL should speak up.

**Duration**: 1 hour max.

**Frequency**: once per week per group.

**Purpose**: Plan out the work for the coming week and ensure that plan is reasonable and makes sense.

## Daily standup

**Who**: This is run by the JTL. Scrum master need not be present but should observe from time to time

**Duration**: 15 minutes

**Frequency**. Daily at the same time. It needs to be a time that fits the group AND keeps the JTL productive. The time can be negotiated with the group if needed.

**Purpose**: Make sure everyone is on track towards their sprint goal. Coordinate work within the group and highlight and resolve impediments.

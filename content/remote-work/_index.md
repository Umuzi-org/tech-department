title: Umuzi Remote work

Umuzi is moving towards a remote work situation. We can't say exactly how long this will last. However we can say that there are many dev and creative teams all over the world that prefer remote work to on premesis work. And we have been learning from those people.

Basically we aim to make sure that this time is as productive and safe for everyone as possible. We all need to adapt to get this right. And we as an organisation believe we'll learn a tonne from this experience.

Now, as you know, we are all about that human-centered life. And this experience has a bunch of different humans involved. You'll see a few different documents in this section for different categories of users. You might actually fit into multiple categories. In this case you'll need to follow multiple recipes.

Before we get started here I would like to ask for your patience. We have a plan, but it'll probably have a few bad assumptions and inefficiencies. We're all in this together, so let us know if you think there is something we should be doing better and we will do our best to adapt. Change is life

## Foundations

No matter what category of user you are, you'll be using a couple of fundamental tools for communication

1. Rocketchat. You'll be expected to be online a lot. Not 100% of the time, but you will be expected to check your messages every morning and every 2 to 3 hours at least. Rocketchat is where the action is at.
2. Google calandars. We'll be scheduling a lot of video calls. Workshops, demos, meetings, they'll all pop up on your Google calandar with nice links to video conferencing. Needless to say, if something is compulsory for you then you should be there. So check your calandar. With your eyes. Generally I just keep it open in a tab on my computer and it warns me if an appointment is drawing near. I'd recommend you do similarly.
3. Discord. Some things just work better with voice instead of text. Sometimes text looses its tone and seems just plain rude when no offence was meant. Sometimes nuance gets lost. Discord is a really really good and free voice client. It was originally built for gamers but now it's used all over the place.

## Other stuff

- Please check your Umuzi email address once per day
- there is a whatsapp group for the tech deparment, but any official communication should happen on Rocketchat or Email

Have some links

- If you are still working on your syllabus: {{% contentlink "content/remote-work/tech-recruits" %}}
- If you are on a product team: {{% contentlink "content/remote-work/tech-product-teams" %}}

So long as we optimise for good, solid, professional communication good things will follow.

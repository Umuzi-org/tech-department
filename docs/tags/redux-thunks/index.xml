      <description>Instructions Now one super cool thing about redux is that you dont really have to dispatch actions one at a time. You can have an action with side effects, and those side effects can dispatch other actions!
There are two main ways to handle side effects in redux. Thunks and Sagas. Thunks are the easy way, and they are worth understanding before movin onto sagas.
Your mission is to create a few more actions that use Thunks to combine a few of your existing actions.</description>

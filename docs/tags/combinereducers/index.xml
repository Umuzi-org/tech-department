      <description>Instructions Often Redux is tied to pretty complicated applications. There are often many pages, widgets and whatnots that need to be controlled. As things get complicated your reducer can get really really big.
That&amp;rsquo;s why redux has a thing called CombineReducers, it lets you split things up a bit.
Create a few seperate reducers to control different things. You could have a sperate reducer per room, or you could have a sperate reducer for each major function (eg: you could have a &amp;ldquo;lighting&amp;rdquo; reducer that controls the lights for the whole house).</description>

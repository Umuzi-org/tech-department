      <description>The contents of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) for every year dating back to 1990 is available on the South African Government website. This gives us a great opportunity to look at the priorities and challenges have faced over time, and the focus points for the various presidents over this time.
 Create a corpus from the English-language text for the SONAs dating back to 2000. Save them with the speaker information and date for later analysis.</description>

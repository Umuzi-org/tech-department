      <description>The objective of this project is to build a calulator that can perform multiplication and addition on multiple integers. Do not build a front-end (UI). Complete this project by using a TDD approach.
The basic TDD approach is as follows:
 RED: Write tests. It should fail initially because there isn&amp;rsquo;t any code that it is testing. GREEN: Write code to make the tests pass. REFACTOR: Make sure code is understandable and clean.</description>

      <description>This a continuation of PROJECTS: simple-calculator part 1 . If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that yet then please do. At this point you should have a well tested add and multiply function.
This exercise will require a little OOP knowledge. Brace yourself.
Set up your environment Javascript Please test your code using jasmine.
Your directory structure should look like this.
 &amp;gt;node_modules &amp;lt;---- make sure this is in your .gitignore &amp;gt;spec &amp;gt; support - jasmine.</description>

      <description>Background The training dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania. This data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge.
Each individual is classified into four mutually exclusive categories:
 No_financial_services: Individuals who do not use mobile money, do not save, do not have credit, and do not have insurance Other_only: Individuals who do not use mobile money, but do use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance) Mm_only: Individuals who use mobile money only Mm_plus: Individuals who use mobile money and also use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)  This dataset is the geospatial mapping of all cash outlets in Tanzania in 2012.</description>

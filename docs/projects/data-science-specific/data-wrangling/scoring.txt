# IPIP Big-Five Factor Markers

 A measure of the big five personality traits; namely, extraversion, neuroticism,
 agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience.
 This test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool,
 developed by Goldberg (1992). It takes most people 3-8 minutes to complete.

## Questionnaire scoring
The test consists of fifty items rated agree, neutral or disagree. To keep scoring consistent with the
original five point scale, items are scored 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral and 5=Agree.

Scores are saved as tuples. The first value of the tuple always indicates the subscale to which the item belongs:
1 = Extraversion, 2 = Agreeableness, 3 = Conscientiousness, 4 = Emotional Stability/Neuroticism, and 5 = Intellect/Imagination / openness to experiences).
The second value in the tuple indicates the individual's scored response to that question (i.e., 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral and 5=Agree).

Sum all of the individual's responses within a subscale (e.g. extraversion) to obtain a total subscale score.
In other words, the second number in the tuple should be scored for all columns with the same number in the first position (1 indicates extraversion, for example).

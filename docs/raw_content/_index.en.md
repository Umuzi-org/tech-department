# Umuzi Tech Department

This website/repo is the source of truth around what and how we teach here in Umuzi's tech department. Let me show you around:

#### If you want to contribute to this repo

Take a look at the [contribution guide](/how-to-contribute) guide. This guide will tell you basically how this application works and will give you info on what a good pull request looks like.

#### If you are a recruit

This [here](/department-processes/what-recruits-need-to-know/) is basically how we work.

If you want to see the entire syllabus (as it currently exists) then take a look [here](/syllabuses). What you see in this section is constantly evolving based on feedback from you and from industry.

If you think anything we have in here can be improved upon we would love to know! You can even make a pull request. If we merge your stuff then you will show up on out [credits](/credits) page. Cool, eh?

You are probably looking for our department processes documentation. Take a look [here](/department-processes).

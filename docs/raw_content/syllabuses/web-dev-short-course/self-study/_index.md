For the most part the web-dev short course is based on projects. Recruits are expected to walk away with a solid understanding of many topics. While projects are underway, the recruits are expected to work their way through the followingt material:

- Command-line bootcamp: This will get you up to speed with the basics of terminal usage: http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/
- Intro to linux presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dhj1-p9Ufl4ilSy_Nu8sw-kuNVWkSvhp0dn5KGo9TyY/edit
- Sheena's awesome linux mint post-install guide: https://gitlab.com/prelude-open-source/mint-post-install-guide (you can skip the parts about python, virtualenv, pip)
- There is a website called stackoverflow that is completely amazing. You can ask tech questions there and they will get answered by kind and knowledgeable strangers. So long as you ask proper questions: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
- This is the Git book.. Git is great. long live the git. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 Git should be installed by default on linux mint. We'll be using github a lot. And this book is way too big. If you get familiar with chaplets 1-3 it will serve you well

You can also continue with the FreeCodeCamp syllabus on your own time. Ideally you will be pretty familiar with this stuff:

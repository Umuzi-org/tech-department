Product teams are teams of no more than 6 recruits guided by a product owner (Umuzi staff). The teams use the Scrum methodology to build real-world, web-based products. Recruits learn additional frameworks (e.g., Django) and packages as needed for the products.

An example of a current product is Umuzi’s online application process. In the past, Umuzi has used a combination of Google Forms and other, off-the-shelf, tools, to create an online application process for applicants. Now, under the leadership of Umuzi’s Data Science and Web Development managers, a team of Umuzi recruits is developing a custom solution which will allow applicants to apply to Umuzi, complete a variety of online learning and tests, enable managers to easily sort candidates by results, and automatically handle communications with the candidates. It’s through real builds like this that recruits put their learning into practice.
Additional learning
In addition to the curriculum listed above, the recruits participate in workshops given by industry professionals and Umuzi staff. Generally there are 2-3 workshops each month. Topics include time management, public speaking, networking, preparing for technical interviews, introduction to new frameworks, tech trends, etc.

Recruits are also encouraged to attend industry meetups, conferences, and hackathons. On average, recruits attend 1 meetup/conference per month and 1-2 hackathons during their time at Umuzi.

title: Semitone Challenge
ready: True
---

This is a multi-step project designed to level up many different skills.

We want to see the following skills demonstrated in different parts of this project:

- code structure
- functions
- loops
- conditions
- datatypes
- operators
- DOM maipulation

This project should be completed in a TDD way. This includes writing unit tests around the DOM!

Ok...so WTF is a semitone? I'm glad you asked. Take a look at these links:

- https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-note-circle-bc-152
- https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/note-circle-with-a-jam-buddy-mt-106

What we want to do is build a simple application that a musician can use to test their music theory skillz.

In the second video, Justin talks about a game that you can play with a jam buddy. Your buddy picks two notes from the note circle and tells them to you, then you tell your buddy how many semi-tones seperate those notes. That is basically what we are building here.

The final goal is to have a program that outputs two notes from the note circle and then allows the user to enter a number. The program needs to be ablt to tell the user if they chose the correct number or not.

For those of you studying web dev, you will be expected to build a simple user interface for this thing using vanilla js. For those of you studying Python you can make a command-line utility that does this.

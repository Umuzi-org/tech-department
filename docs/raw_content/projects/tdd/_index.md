title: Test Driven Development
---

The exercises in this section can be done in any language. The aim is to have working logic, not a beautiful user interface. You will be expected to demonstrate your working code and also to build on lessons you have already learned.

- if you know OOP please use it where it is appropriate
- write clean code (it will be reviewed by your peers and by senior staff)
- use Git from the command line. This is a suuuper important skill in industry
- have fun :) (but not too much)

There are a few exercises here. Try the ones marked as easy first.

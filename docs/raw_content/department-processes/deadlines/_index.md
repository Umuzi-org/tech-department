title: Deadlines
---

If there is a deadline for any cohort then that deadline should be shared in the "tech deadlines" calender. To do this:

- create an event in your own calendar.
- name it in an informative way (name the assignment, name the part of the assignment, who is the deadline for? eg: C13 web)
- in the description of the event add any links, descriptions or requirements that might be useful
- invite the deadline calender to the event

Note: For the event to be accepted by the deadlines calender it has to have a duration. If your event is eg from 8:00 to 8:00 then it will be automatically rejected.

Clear instructions on how to submit the event should be included on the event. For example if it is a gnomio assignment then that should be stated. If the assignment makes use of the code submission form then a link to the form should be included.

## Late submissions

The person who sets a deadline will check who submitted and who is outstanding.

If a recruit is then:

- send a slack message to each recruit who is late
- share a list of all late people with the rest of the tech team on slack? Or email? (should we have a specific channel?)

In the next cohort standup meeting:

- the recruits who submitted late will be verbally warned. They will need to submit their work by the next morning

If the recruit does not submit their work after being verbally warned then a senior tech manager will personally:

- email all the recruits who have missed their deadline (other managers should be CC'd). This counts as a WRITTEN WARNING
- have a meeting with the offending recruits. This can be a short meeting, and it can be a group meeting.

## repeat offenders

If a recruit gets 3 written warnings or 9 verbal warnings (or a combination, eg 1 written warning and 6 verbal warnings) then there will be a formal disciplinary hearing held by an HR representative. A senior tech manager will provide HR with all evidence.

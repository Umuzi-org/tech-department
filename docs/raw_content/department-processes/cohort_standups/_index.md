title: Cohort morning standups
---

Standups happen first thing in the morning. These will usually be run by junior facilitators

## Before standup, the facilitator will

- check the calenders and make sure they are familiar with upcoming events and deadlines
- check slack in case there are any important messages that should be conveyed to their groups. Eg: "only half the C23Zs have submitted their rocket-surgery assignments"

## During standup, the facilitator will

- attendance will be checked
- if anyone has missed a deadline then they will be verbally warned

A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.
-- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

Regular expressions are very useful. We use them to:

- validate user input
- url matching: If you are working with any kind of web backend technology you will come across this
- extracting and cleaning data
  And many many other things

It's not worth memorizing this stuff, but you should understand it.
